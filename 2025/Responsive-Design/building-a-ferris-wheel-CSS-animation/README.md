# Ferris Wheel with CSS Animation 🎡

A visually engaging HTML/CSS project that simulates a spinning Ferris wheel using pure CSS animation. This exercise explores how to apply animation principles with `@keyframes`, transforms, and positioning — creating a dynamic, interactive display using semantic HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and element organization
- **CSS3** – Transforms, animations, `@keyframes`, positioning

## Main Features

- Circular rotating structure animated using CSS `@keyframes`
- Counter-rotating cabins with dynamic background color transitions
- Use of `transform-origin`, `rotate()`, and `position: absolute` to simulate real-world wheel motion
- Practical use of animation shorthand, timing functions, and infinite looping
- Clean structure using relative/absolute positioning and `nth-of-type()` for layout control

## Setup Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Make sure `index.html` and `styles.css` are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How to Use It

- Modify keyframe timings and easing (`linear`, `ease-in-out`) to explore motion styles.
- Adjust rotation degrees or cabin positions to experiment with layout symmetry.
- Use this as a foundation to understand how animation transforms affect elements over time.

## Project Status

✅ Completed as a CSS animation and transform-focused practice project.
