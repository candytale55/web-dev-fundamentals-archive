## General info
The purpose of this project is to edit an existing _Tsunami Coffee_ website code using relative units and responsive web design so that the website appears correctly on varying screen sizes. 


## Features
List of features ready:

The **_.container_** class limits the with of the sections to a specific widht (making them not as wide as the screen)

**_.main section_** displays a background image in the main section at the top of the page, with the _Tsunami Coffee_ logo in the middle and contains the navigation menu (_Store, Hours, Wholesale_).

Followed by 4 div sections (_.supporting_, _.rating_, _.gallery_, _.location_)

**_.supporting_**: includes an image of three beans to the left and a description of the company set in a div with class _.description_ to the right.

**_.rating_**: includes a _critique_ and rating by a _"Coffee critic"_. in a _div.container_

**_.gallery_**: contains three images, they are set to show the three in the same line. 

**_.location_**: contains a map and a legend _"Brewed with love in ..."_ 

**_footer_**: Includes a copyright and the navigation menu at the bottom of the page. 



### To-do list for future development
* Add link interaction (hover, active, etc.)
* Fix those media queries for gallery in smaller sizes.
* Maybe add menu items. 
* The footer is too high.
