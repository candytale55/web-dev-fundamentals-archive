Still, there is a degree of nostalgia that is more comforting than <u><b>grievous</b></u>; the thrill of quickening her horse to sprint, the toss of strong winds blowing her hair behind her, an elevated mood from an activity far more invigorating than routine exercises in the walls.	Aún así, hay un grado de nostalgia que es más reconfortante que <u><b>doloroso</b></u>; la emoción de acelerar su caballo para correr, el soplo de los fuertes vientos moviendo su cabello detrás de ella, un estado de ánimo elevado de una actividad mucho más vigorizante que los ejercicios de rutina en las paredes.

Their time spent together in the past and the eruption of a dreamworld in the years since have blurred together. Wounds from the truth merge with the self-inflicted torture of her fictions.

En el <b><u>vértice</u></b> de su muslo, una marca singular que no se puede confundir con nada más… <em>la lengua de Levi marcándola en el borde de la piel y el algodón negro, un beso tan fuerte que sus piernas tiemblan cuando se abren más para él</em>… una mordida de amor.	
Unwilling to wait for the heatthe <b><u>subside</u></b>, refusing to finish what she started, she <u><b>tugs</b></u> <b><u>on</u></b> fresh clothing and haphazardly buttons her top (misses a button, has to redo all of them). Once she unties the flap to her tent's entrance and steps outside, she's immediately overtaken by the vibrant colors, woodland scents of damp moss and pine, and cordial commotion of the caravan's breakfast plans.	No dispuesta a esperar a que el calor <b><u>disminuya</u></b>, negándose a terminar lo que empezó, <u><b>se pone</b></u> ropa limpia y se abrocha la blusa descuidadamente (sé salta un botón, tiene que rehacerlos todos). Una vez que desata la solapa de la entrada de su tienda y sale, los colores vibrantes, los aromas del bosque de musgo húmedo y pino y la conmoción cordial de los planes de desayuno de la caravana la superan de inmediato.

En los momentos en que se requiere su mutua presencia, ella es la estatua practicada de la guardia de la Reina que Levi (no, el Comandante Erwin) <b><u>menospreciaba</u></b>; <u><b>reticiente</b></u> y <u><b>sin afectación</b></u>.<br><br>Reticiencia: desconfianza o cautela.<br><br>Unaffected: 1. Showing no changes. 2. Without artificiality or insincerity.	
"""You know, I'm not sure whether to be offended or to pity you, that it took your <u><b>adamant</b></u> need to avoid me to actually befriend another person."" Almost <u><b>wistful</b></u>, he adds, ""A normal person, too.""<br><br>Mikasa narrows her eyes. ""I'm not avoiding you."""	"""Sabes, no estoy seguro de si sentirme ofendido o sentir lástima por ti, que fue tu necesidad <u><b>imperiosa</b></u> de evitarme lo que te llevó a hacerte amiga de otra persona"". Casi <u><b>melancólico</b></u>, agrega: ""Una persona normal también"". <br><br>Mikasa entrecierra los ojos. ""No te estoy evitando."""	
An <u><b>unspoken</b></u> rhythm of taking turns, their touches alternate from the tease of a <u><b>skimming touch</b></u> to a more deliberate massage, and Mikasa isn't sure which she prefers. She only knows she doesn't want it to stop.	Un ritmo <u><b>tácito</b></u> de turnos, sus toques alternan desde la provocación de un <b><u>toque de roce</u></b> hasta un masaje más deliberado, y Mikasa no está segura de cuál prefiere. Ella solo sabe que no quiere que se detenga.	
Whatever complications erupted from the morning in the meadow can be avoided now if she settles for the subtle touches and a casual exit. Even with <em><b>her entire frame</b></em> aching to stay, and errant thoughts running <u><b>rampant</b></u> in hope he'll ask her to, she makes to leave like usual. Levi doesn't stop her.	Cualquier complicación que surgió de la mañana en el prado puede evitarse ahora si se conforma con los toques sutiles y una salida casual. Incluso con <em><b>todo su cuerpo</b></em> ansioso por quedarse, y los pensamientos errantes corriendo <b><u><b>desenfrenados</b></u></b> con la esperanza de que él se lo pida, ella se marcha como de costumbre. Levi no la detiene.	
He simply nods. Actual words of farewell often are <u><b>forfeited</b></u> by the both of them so she doesn't bother to summon a worthy sentiment now.	Él simplemente asiente. Las palabras de despedida reales a menudo son <u><b>perdidas | ignoradas</b></u> por ambos, por lo que ella no se molesta en convocar un sentimiento digno ahora.<br><br>	
Mikasa takes the first step out the door and focuses on the <u><b>pelting</b></u> of cold rain on her bare skin as she descends the few stairs from his front porch. She sees the pebble path that felt like an insurmountable distance earlier, but realizes crossing it to leave now is significantly worse. Each step <b>feels weighted</b>, and it has nothing to do with her clothing already being drenched.	Mikasa da el primer paso hacia la puerta y se concentra en la lluvia fría <u><b>que cae</b></u> sobre su piel desnuda mientras baja los pocos escalones desde su porche delantero. Ella ve el camino empedrado que antes parecía una distancia insuperable, pero se da cuenta de que cruzarlo para irse ahora es significativamente peor. Cada paso <u><b>se siente pesado</b></u> y no tiene nada que ver con que su ropa ya esté empapada.	
Contrary to popular belief, Levi does know the taste of fear. He tastes it now, metallic and sharp, almost convincing him there's blood <u><b>lining his teeth</b></u> and <u><b>dappling</b></u> onto his tongue.	Contrariamente a la creencia popular, Levi conoce el sabor del miedo. Ahora lo prueba, metálico y afilado, casi convenciéndolo de que hay sangre en <u><b>cubriendo sus dientes</b></u> y <u><b>manchando</b></u> su lengua.	
He is still thoughtful as he returns her embrace, <b><em>breathing her in</em></b>— rainwater, muted fragrances of jasmine and <em><b>vetiver</b></em>, and the <u><b>subtle tang</b></u> of a light sweat he's known as hers for over a decade.	Él todavía está pensativo mientras le devuelve el abrazo, <b><em>inspirándola</em></b>: agua de lluvia, fragancias apagadas de jazmín y <u><b>vetiver</b></u>, y el <u><b>sutil sabor</b></u> de un sudor ligero que él conoce como suyo durante más de una década.<br><br>Vetiver = Chrysopogon zizanioides 	
His worn down boots, his dull and broken blade, and his near-empty <u><b>waterskin</b></u>; that was all he had left on him, <u><b>bar</b></u> the tattered remains of his uniform. He’d <u><b>ditched</b></u> the jacket a few days ago.	Sus botas gastadas, su hoja desafilada y rota y su <u><b>odre de agua</b></u> casi vacío; eso era todo lo que le quedaba, <u><b>salvo</b></u> los andrajosos restos de su uniforme. Se había <u><b>deshecho</b></u> de la chaqueta hace unos días.	
The summer sun was <u><b>blaring</b></u> down on him as he travelled and the fabric that was left of it did nothing but warm him up. He <b><u>tore off</u></b> a strip to tie around the wound on his arm and used the rest as campfire fuel. He wouldn’t last until the weather grew cold again.	El sol de <u><b>verano</b></u> brillaba sobre él mientras viajaba y la tela que quedaba de él <em>(del uniforme)</em> no hacía más que calentarlo. <u><b>Arrancó</b></u> una tira para atar alrededor de la herida de su brazo y usó el resto como combustible para fogatas. No duraría hasta que el clima volviera a enfriar.	
Levi coughed – that involuntary, dry sort of cough when your throat is <u><b>parched</b></u> and hot – <u><b>spluttering</b></u> as he felt his pace slow. 	Levi tosió, esa especie de tos seca e involuntaria cuando tu garganta está <u><b>seca</b></u> y caliente, <u><b>farfullando</b></u> cuando sintió que su ritmo se ralentizaba.	
He opened his waterskin, and let out a <u><b>wheeze of a laugh</b></u> as he saw the <u><b>thimbleful</b></u> of water he had left for himself. He stared at it for a moment, <u><b>tilting</b></u> it towards the sunlight for examination. Maybe it was better to leave it. Get it over with sooner.	Abrió su odre de agua y soltó una <u><b>carcajada</b></u> al ver el <u><b>dedal</b></u> de agua que le quedaba. Lo miró por un momento, <u><b>inclinándolo</b></u> hacia la luz del sol para examinarlo. Quizás era mejor dejarlo. Terminar con ello lo antes posible.	
Levi rose to rest on his <u><b>haunches</b></u>, gathering his sword once more and looking upstream. The water ran ever so slightly faster further up the hill.	Levi se levantó para descansar en <u><b>cuclillas</b></u>, recogió su espada una vez más y miró río arriba. El agua corría un poco más rápido colina arriba.	
An oasis. Above him, lush green and vibrant plant life <u><b>draped over</b></u> a <u><b>craggy</b></u> <em><b>outcrop</b></em> guarding a pool of water.	Un oasis. Por encima de él, una exuberante vegetación verde y vibrante <u><b>cubría</b></u> un <em><b>afloramiento</b></em> <u><b>escarpado</b></u> que guardaba un charco de agua.	
When it came to the people in his life that truly mattered, first impressions typically didn’t mean <u><b>jack shit</b></u>.	Cuando se trataba de las personas en su vida que realmente importaban, las primeras impresiones generalmente no significaban <u><b>una mierda</b></u>.	
There was something caught in her throat — mean, very mean and desperate to get out, <u><b>to get a rise out</b></u> of this man. A childish response, perhaps, but her pride was nagging at her and it agreed <u><b>to pipe down</b></u> if she would say the next few words.	Había algo atrapado en su garganta - malvado, muy malvado y desesperado por salir, <u><b>hacer enfadar</b></u> a este hombre. Una respuesta infantil, tal vez, pero su orgullo la molestaba y accedió a <u><b>callarse</b></u> si decía las siguientes palabras.	
The captain had <b><u>clamped himself around</u></b> her body with an iron grip like he half-expects her to flee from the chaos she had brought upon herself. Instead, Mikasa had <u><b>rooted</b></u> herself firmly in place and promised <u><b>to see it through</b></u>.	El Capitán se había <u><b>sujetado alrededor</b></u> de su cuerpo con un agarre de hierro como si medio esperara que ella huyera del caos que se había provocado a sí misma. En cambio, Mikasa se había <b><u>arraigado</u></b> firmemente en su lugar y prometió <u><b>llevarlo a cabo.</b></u>	
She narrowed her eyes right back at him when she could feel the beginnings of tears <u><b>smarting</b></u> at the corners.	Ella entrecerró los ojos de vuelta a él cuando pudo sentir el comienzo de las lágrimas <b><u>ardiendo</u></b> en las esquinas.	
“Amidst the <u><b>struggle and strife</b></u> of our times, a hero rises from the ashes. Lance Corporal Levi Ackerman is an outstanding soldier who has <u><b>wrought</b></u> vast destruction upon the titans over the years, earning him the title of ‘Humanity’s Strongest’. But take extra note, for this man’s <u><b>prowess</b></u> on the battlefield is equally matched by his prowess in the bedroom. Despite his chibi build, one <u><b>sultry</b></u> look from this corporal will have your skin burning hotter than titan flesh <u><b><em>rent</em></b></u> <em><b><u>asunder</u></b></em> by his twin blades of justice.

“Well, if it isn’t Levi!” A <u><b>brash</b></u> and cheerful Hange plonked herself down next to him. “You’re looking <b><u>chipper</u></b> today!”	"""¡Bueno, si no es Levi!"" Una Hange <b><u>impetuosa</u></b> y alegre se dejó caer a su lado. ""¡Te ves más <b><u>alegre</u></b> hoy!"""	
“If I’d known that our military was a <u><b>hotbed</b></u> of sex-hungry maniacs I would have stayed Underground,” Levi growled. He reached for his dessert, then stopped abruptly.	"""Si hubiera sabido que nuestro ejército era un <u><b>hervidero</b></u> de maníacos hambrientos de sexo, me habría quedado en la Ciudad Subterránea"", gruñó Levi. Alcanzó su postre y luego se detuvo abruptamente."	
On this day, however, there was a different atmosphere in mess hall. The recruits spoke in hushed voices, and he noticed with irritation the <b><u>sly</u></b> glances of many female recruits directed his way.	Ese día, sin embargo, había una atmósfera diferente en el comedor. Los reclutas hablaban en voz baja y él notó con irritación las miradas <u><b>maliciosas</b></u> de muchas reclutas dirigían hacia él.	
We will also give the surfaces a quick clean.” The squad groaned in unison. Wall cleaning was unpleasant because it was dull and time-consuming. It was also a necessary evil, since dirt and moss could stop their <u><b>grappling</b></u> hooks from attaching effectively.	También le daremos una limpieza rápida a las superficies ”. El escuadrón gimió al unísono. La limpieza del Muro era desagradable porque era aburrida y consumía mucho tiempo. También era un mal necesario, ya que la suciedad y el musgo podían evitar que sus ganchos <b><u>de agarre</u></b> se adhirieran de manera efectiva.	
“Well, you’re featured in a column in the newspaper, they even gave you a title! What was it…ah…”<br><br>“Humanity’s Hottest.”<br><br>All heads turned to stare down the end of the table at Mikasa, who <b><em>sported</em></b> a <u><b>deadpan</b></u> expression. Water spurted from Eren’s nose.	Todas las cabezas se volvieron para mirar al final de la mesa a Mikasa, quien <b><em>lucía una expresión </em></b><u><b>inexpresiva</b></u>.	
To Levi’s <u><b>chagrin</b></u>, things got even worse. “Oh yeah, that’s the one! But there was another nickname they gave you in the picture caption – “<br><br>“Chibi.”<br><br>“No – “<br><br>“Strawberry boy.” 	"Para <u><b>disgusto</b></u> de Levi, las cosas empeoraron. ""¡Oh, sí, ese es el indicado! Pero había otro apodo que te dieron en la leyenda de la imagen: """	
“Jaeger, stuff your snot back into your nose. Arlert, stop shaking like you’ve got dysfunctional ODM gear up your ass. Braus, self-cannibalism is a good contingency in the absence of meat. You're beyond saving Springer, but Ackerman, raise your intelligence by reading more sophisticated material,” Levi shot.<br><br>“The Trost Tribute is the military’s stock newspaper, which I read to stay updated with current affairs. There was more about you in this morning’s one, but you tossed that to the floor when we came in.” Mikasa said.		
“No, you misunderstand! I was thinking that if we need a quick ambush strategy, Eren could transform and the soldiers could hide in his mouth, and at a signal they could all burst out and start attacking the enemy…”<br><br>“So you’re turning Jaeger into a <u><b>broodmother</b></u>.”	"“¡No, lo malinterpretas! Estaba pensando que si necesitábamos una estrategia de emboscada rápida, Eren podría transformarse y los soldados podrían esconderse en su boca, y a una señal todos podrían estallar y comenzar a atacar al enemigo ... ""<br><br> ""Así que estás convirtiendo a Jaeger en una <u><b>madre de cría</b></u>""."	
"She reached for the bottle, drinking from it deeply before speaking. ""You're abrasive.""<br><br>He let out a dark huff of amusement. ""That's a fucking <u><b>understatement</b></u>."" He tossed the wrapper back into the box. ""You aren't exactly all sugary sweetness either, Mikasa.""<br><br>She smiled softly—saw him go very still. ""Also another <u><b>understatement</b></u>, Levi."""	"Cogió la botella y bebió profundamente antes de hablar. ""Eres abrasivo"".<br><br> Dejó escapar un oscuro bufido de diversión. ""Eso es un jodido <u><b>eufemismo</b></u>."" Volvió a arrojar el envoltorio a la caja. <br><br>""Tú tampoco eres exactamente toda dulzura azucarada, Mikasa."" <br><br>Ella sonrió suavemente, lo vio quedarse muy quieto. ""También otra <u><b>subestimación</b></u>, Levi."""	
“What the hell…” The words died on his tongue as she lifted the dress up slowly, widening her stance as she <u><b>slunk it up</b></u> inch by inch. He felt his <u><b>breath catch</b></u> with every inch she exposed, his eyes trailing up her narrow waist, up the delicate muscles of her back.	"""Qué demonios ..."" Las palabras murieron en su lengua mientras ella levantaba el vestido lentamente, ampliando su postura mientras lo <u><b>deslizaba</b></u> centímetro a centímetro. Sintió que se le <u><b>cortaba el aliento</b></u> con cada centímetro que ella exponía, sus ojos recorrían su estrecha cintura, los delicados músculos de su espalda."	
Mikasa talks to herself while she thinks. It isn't something she notices at first, not until it <u><b>garners</b></u> Armin's <u><b>sheepish</b></u> smile and Levi's snapping reproach— <em>There's a reason it's called classified, Ackerman.</em> Turns out she only does it in moments of intense thought on newer or unfamiliar subjects, at least.	Mikasa habla consigo misma mientras piensa. No es algo que se dé cuenta al principio, no hasta que <u><b>cosecha</b></u> la sonrisa <u><b>tímida</b></u> de Armin y el reproche de Levi. <em>Hay una razón por la que se llama clasificado, Ackerman</em>. Resulta que solo lo hace en momentos de intensa reflexión sobre temas nuevos o desconocidos, al menos.	
"Her specialized training regiments with Captain Levi are always brutal, but today's round of obstacles is what the others have labeled the ""insane and inhumane Ackerman course."" Mikasa calls it attempted murder. After scaling the cliff's edge by hand, ruthless sparring, dodging bullets, and sprinting through sand dunes, she's desperate for <u><b>reprieve</b></u>."	Después de escalar el borde del acantilado a mano, pelear despiadadamente, esquivar balas y correr a través de las dunas de arena, está desesperada por un <u><b>respiro</b></u>.	
Broken sounds – chattering teeth, hoarse whispers – and thrashing movement– violent tremors, aching limbs. Ice has been sewn through to prevent the fluttering of her eyelids. The <u><b>burgeoning</b></u> of half-consciousness is distant from the sensation of a human host; chilled so thoroughly she no longer feels cold. Cold is <u><b>asinine</b></u>, frozen is an afterthought; nothingness is so much more, and so much less, than coldness.	Sonidos rotos - castañeteo de dientes, susurros roncos - y movimiento de golpes - temblores violentos, miembros doloridos. Ha cosido hielo para evitar el aleteo de sus párpados. El <u><b>florecimiento</b></u> de la semiconsciencia está distante de la sensación de un huésped humano; helada tanto que ya no siente frío. El frío es <u><b>estúpido</b></u>, la congelacion es una ocurrencia tardía; la nada es mucho más, y mucho menos, que la frialdad.	
Levi is certain he's never <u><b>hollered</b></u> so much in his life and the Universe mocks him for it: she can't hear a damn word. What little foresight he had prompted him to tear off his cloak before diving into the water and he remembers now that it's still in the small boat.	Levi está seguro de que nunca ha <u><b>gritado</b></u> tanto en su vida y el Universo se burla de él por eso: ella no puede oír una maldita palabra. La poca previsión que tuvo lo llevó a arrancarse la capa antes de sumergirse en el agua y ahora recuerda que todavía está en el bote pequeño.	
This ain’t <u><b>Manumission</b></u>	Manumisión es el acto y el resultado de manumitir: otorgarle la libertad a una persona que estaba sometida a la esclavitud. ... La manumisión, en este marco, es el proceso que posibilita la liberación del esclavo. Así, gracias a la manumisión, el esclavo puede transformarse en un liberto.	
The public loved to see them fighting together, bathed in blood as murderous monsters; pairing them — even if the rest of the <u><b>lanistas</b></u> considered her presence offensive — turned into massive admiration and an extremely profitable business.	Un Lanista era un hombre que compraba y cuidaba gladiadores. Pueden ganar muchas riquezas en la compra y venta de gladiadores, pero su estatus social se considera bajo. Cuando se compra un gladiador, se forman compañías llamadas casas. El lanista es también el encargado de la formación de los gladiadores.	
He watched her swing her leg over the second wire. She was going to <u><b>straddle</b></u> it. Oh. Levi turned away once she started making circular motions with her hips.	La vio pasar la pierna por el segundo cable. Ella iba a <u><b>montar a horcajadas</b></u>. Oh. Levi se alejó una vez que comenzó a hacer movimientos circulares con las caderas.	
This was turning into a war of <u><b>attrition</b></u>, and neither of them was sure if they could win.	Esto se estaba convirtiendo en una guerra de <u><b>desgaste</b></u>, y ninguno de los dos estaba seguro de poder ganar.	
"""Right, if we're all done dealing with our <u><b>monthlies</b></u> can we move on and decide what we're going to do next? Because I'd rather not spend the rest of my life hiding in a forest from a Titan and the MPs, especially with you three."" Ymir lazily draped an arm over Historia's shoulder, trying to sound bored and indifferent. But the tightness of her jaw and visible tension in her <u><b>stance</b></u> betrayed how on edge she truly was."	"""Bien, si todos terminamos de lidiar con nuestros <u><b>informes mensuales</b></u>, ¿podemos seguir adelante y decidir qué vamos a hacer a continuación? Porque prefiero no pasar el resto de mi vida escondiéndome en un bosque de un Titán y los MP. , especialmente con ustedes tres "". Ymir pasó perezosamente un brazo sobre el hombro de Historia, tratando de parecer aburrida e indiferente. Pero la tensión de su mandíbula y la tensión visible en su <u><b>postura</b></u> delataban lo nerviosa que estaba realmente."	
"""How do you know that?"" She demanded, her <u><b>hackles</b></u> still raised. ""And how can we trust them not to rat us out if some more MPs come knocking? Cause I ain't in a trusting mood right now."""	"¿Cómo lo sabes? "", Preguntó, con los <u><b>pelos de punta</b></u> todavía erizados."" ¿Y cómo podemos confiar en que no nos delatarán si vienen a llamar a la puerta algunos parlamentarios más? Porque no estoy de humor para confiar en este momento ""."	
Connie had apologised to him during the walk, and they had made up in the way only guys could. As they neared the two-hour mark of their journey here, Connie had <u><b>fallen into lockstep</b></u> with him, and after several minutes of awkward silence, the shorter teen had broken the tension with an odd question.	Connie se había disculpado con él durante el paseo y se habían reconciliado de la forma en que solo los chicos podían hacerlo. A medida que se acercaban a la marca de dos horas de su viaje hasta aquí, Connie había <u><b>disminuido el paso</b></u> acercándose a él, y después de varios minutos de incómodo silencio, el adolescente más bajo había roto la tensión con una pregunta extraña.	
'Well damn,' Ymir realised with a <u><b>wry</b></u> grin, 'I've been domesticated.'	Bueno, maldita sea —se dio cuenta Ymir con una sonrisa <u><b>irónica</b></u>—, he sido domesticada.	
Even if the little brat was an Ackerman, Kenny took the <u><b>pisspoor</b></u> performance from his team as a personal insult. Had they learnt nothing from his training?	Incluso si el pequeño mocoso era un Ackerman, Kenny se tomó la <u><b>mala</b></u> actuación de su equipo como un insulto personal. ¿No habían aprendido nada de su entrenamiento?	
Hanji, Levi and Erwin looked over towards the speaker, to see the already <u><b>storied</b></u> Mikasa Ackerman, the pride of the 104th and the reaper of Trost having broken ranks from Hanji’s idling group and marched right up to them, indifferent to the looks of incredulity, anger and <u><b>bemusement</b></u> she received.	Hanji, Levi y Erwin miraron hacia el orador, para ver a la ya <u><b>legendaria</b></u> Mikasa Ackerman, el orgullo del 104 y el segador de Trost habiendo roto filas del grupo inactivo de Hanji y marchando hacia ellos, indiferente a las miradas de incredulidad. ira y <u><b>desconcierto</b></u> que recibió.	
What Mikasa did next Hanji would remember for years to come. In the face of a loud, aggressive <u><b>chastisement</b></u> from the most fearsome and deadly soldier the corp had, Mikasa hadn't even flinched. She just looked at Levi out of the corner of her eye as if he was two inches tall. No words were spoken, and no apology was given - just a <em>look</em>.	Lo que Mikasa hizo a continuación, Hanji lo recordaría en los años venideros. Ante un fuerte y agresivo <u><b>castigo</b></u> del soldado más temible y mortal que tenía el cuerpo, Mikasa ni siquiera se había inmutado. Ella solo miró a Levi por el rabillo del ojo como si tuviera cinco centímetros de altura. No se pronunció ninguna palabra ni se disculpó, solo una <em>mirada</em>.	
Today had been perhaps the single most emotionally draining experience since their return to the past. Since they had dealt with Bertholdt as the moon had started its slow descent, in one day Mikasa had watched Armin re-inherited the Colossal and its curse, believed (incorrectly) they had been <u><b>sussed</b></u> out by Erwin, found out that Eren had been kidnapped by Rod and Kenny, discovered that Reiner had slipped through their fingers, realised Historia’s identity had been partially unveiled, had a brief and semi-heated argument with Armin and, to top it all off, she had reunited with that man who gave his life trying to save Eren and herself from the smiling Titan, who just so happened to be the first Mrs Yeager; Zeke’s mother and Aunty Carla’s killer.	Hoy había sido quizás la experiencia más emocionalmente agotadora desde su regreso al pasado. Desde que se habían ocupado de Bertholdt cuando la luna había comenzado su lento descenso, en un día Mikasa había visto a Armin volver a heredar el Colosal y su maldición, creía (incorrectamente) que Erwin los <u><b>había descubierto</b></u>, descubrió que Eren había sido secuestrado. por Rod y Kenny, descubrió que Reiner se había escapado de sus dedos, se dio cuenta de que la identidad de Historia había sido desvelada parcialmente, tuvo una breve y semicálida discusión con Armin y, para colmo, se había reunido con ese hombre que dio su vida. tratando de salvar a Eren ya ella misma del sonriente Titán, que resultó ser la primera Sra. Yeager; La madre de Zeke y el asesino de la tía Carla.	
Fortunately for Mikasa emotional <u><b>bulwark</b></u>, Levi’s shouted commands to get moving arrived soon after and Hannes offered to walk with her to the horses, which she happily accepted as it allowed her to push back that dreaded goodbye just a few more minutes.	Afortunadamente para el <u><b>baluarte</b></u> emocional de Mikasa, las órdenes a gritos de Levi para que se pusieran en movimiento llegaron poco después y Hannes se ofreció a caminar con ella hacia los caballos, lo que ella aceptó felizmente ya que le permitió rechazar ese temido adiós solo unos minutos más.	
The two men stared at each other, refusing to back down as they both privately <u><b>bemoaned</b></u> the other’s stubbornness.	Los dos hombres se miraron fijamente, negándose a retroceder mientras ambos <u><b>lamentaban</b></u> en privado la terquedad del otro.	
For the first time ever, Armin and Mikasa looked human . Flawed and vulnerable. They looked <u><b>beaten</b></u>, <u><b>despondent</b></u> and <u><b>dejected</b></u>, as if some guiding light they had been following had just been extinguished leaving them <u><b>adrift</b></u> in the void.	Por primera vez, Armin y Mikasa parecían humanos. Defectuosos y vulnerables. Se veían <u><b>abatidos</b></u>, <u><b>abatidos</b></u> y <u><b>abatidos</b></u>, como si alguna luz guía que habían estado siguiendo acabara de apagarse dejándolos a la <u><b>deriva</b></u> en el vacío.	
That, apparently, was the wrong answer to give. Ymir's frown deepened and she <u><b>kissed her teeth</b></u> in annoyance.	Esa, aparentemente, fue la respuesta incorrecta. El ceño de Ymir se profundizó y se <u><b>besó los dientes</b></u> con molestia.<br><br>	
Yet he had <u><b>stuck it out</b></u> ignoring the <u><b>jibes</b></u> and insults from other cadets while stubbornly pushing on through his own inadequacies, it was… admirable.	Sin embargo, se había <u><b>aguantado</b></u> ignorando las <u><b>burlas</b></u> e insultos de otros cadetes mientras seguía obstinadamente a través de sus propias deficiencias, era ... admirable.	
Annie wanted to <u><b>smack</b></u> herself. She had nearly revealed herself all because she got spooked by some dumb animal. Letting out a shaky laugh, she shook her head, placing the blade back in her pocket, <u><b>lambasting</b></u> herself for being so stupid.	Annie quería <u><b>golpearse</b></u> a sí misma. Casi se había revelado todo porque se asustó con un animal tonto. Dejando escapar una risa temblorosa, negó con la cabeza, colocando la hoja de nuevo en su bolsillo, <u><b>arremetiendo</b></u> contra sí misma por ser tan estúpida.	
Only a few more noticed she wasn’t present for hand to hand training that morning, but most assumed she was just <u><b>skiving</b></u> off.	Solo unos pocos más notaron que no estaba presente para el entrenamiento mano a mano esa mañana, pero la mayoría asumió que solo estaba <u><b>escapándose</b></u>.	
As they approached the infiltration spot, he glanced across the city towards the massing Titans in the far corner. They were trying to reach the brave, or insane, soldiers who were <u><b>abseiling</b></u> the wall, but none were tall enough to get close. The city had mostly been emptied, with the majority of titans making their way towards the amassed human defenders on top the wall.	Cuando se acercaron al lugar de infiltración, miró a través de la ciudad hacia los titanes que se concentraban en la esquina más alejada. Estaban tratando de alcanzar a los soldados valientes, o locos, que estaban <u><b>haciendo rápel</b></u> por el muro, pero ninguno era lo suficientemente alto como para acercarse. La ciudad en su mayoría había sido vaciada, y la mayoría de los titanes se dirigían hacia los defensores humanos reunidos en la parte superior de la muralla.	
“Before we could even fully comprehend the <u><b>sheer</b></u> scale of this disaster, Eren turned up…” Mikasa's hand clenched into a fist, as her voice <u><b>tapered</b></u> out. Without thinking, Armin placed his hand over hers, looking at her with concern. Slowly, Mikasa relented and interlaced her fingers with his and squeezed his hand.	"""Antes de que pudiéramos comprender <b><u>completamente</u></b> la magnitud de este desastre, Eren apareció ..."" La mano de Mikasa se apretó en un puño, mientras su voz se <u><b>afinaba</b></u>. Sin pensarlo, Armin puso su mano sobre la de ella, mirándola con preocupación. Lentamente, Mikasa cedió y entrelazó sus dedos con los de él y apretó su mano."	
The <u><b>scrape</b></u> of a shovel sounded approximately half-way down the long row of stalls and she frowned.  Someone would have to finish <u><b>mucking</b></u> the stalls since he’d been apparently <u><b>lollygagging</b></u> this morning.	El <u><b>chirrido</b></u> de una pala sonó aproximadamente a la mitad de la larga fila de puestos y frunció el ceño. Alguien tendría que terminar de <u><b>limpiar</b></u> los puestos, ya que aparentemente había estado <u><b>perdiendo el tiempo</b></u> esta mañana.	
“Good thing we know better, old man.” He <u><b>cuffed</b></u> her lightly on one shoulder, grumbling under his breath about ‘<em>disrespectful brats</em>’ and ‘<em>not even that old</em>’<br>	If you cuff someone, you hit them quickly and lightly with your hand, usually on their head or their ear.<br>Brodie cuffed him on the side of the head.	
Many who met the potato girl left with the incorrect assumption that she was an <u><b>airhead</b></u> and <u><b>scatterbrained</b></u>. Mikasa had shared a dorm room with her for over three years and the other woman was as close a friend to her as Armin was and Eren used to be. She was also the grey-eyed woman’s preferred confidante. She knew how observant Sasha was, how she rarely missed or forgot anything especially concerning her loved ones. It’s why the brunette was the Survey Corps best sharpshooter now and what had helped the two become closer. Sasha could read the reticent woman’s moods at a glance most of the time.	Muchos de los que conocen a la chica de las patatas se quedan con la suposición incorrecta de que es una <u><b>cabeza hueca</b></u> y una <u><b>tonta</b></u>. 	
She looked <u><b>wistfully</b></u> towards the window where sunlight streamed through, ignoring the shadow perched on the <u><b>sill</b></u>. “<em>Don’t even think about it. You have one more day before you’re cleared and we have an expedition in six. I won’t have your ass left behind because you wanted to play with the rest of the brats</em>.”	"Miró con <u><b>nostalgia</b></u> hacia la ventana por donde entraba la luz del sol, ignorando la sombra posada en el <u><b>alféizar</b></u>. ""<em>Ni siquiera lo pienses. Tienes un día más antes de que te den permiso y tengamos una expedición en seis. No dejaré tu trasero atrás porque querías jugar con el resto de los mocosos </em>""."	
Armin slipped through the door, pausing in confusion when he saw Mikasa sitting at the desk sending him a <u><b>beseeching</b></u> look. 	Armin se deslizó por la puerta, deteniéndose confundido cuando vio a Mikasa sentada en el escritorio enviándole una mirada <u><b>suplicante</b></u>.	
Sitting idle was apparently not a concept in the woman’s mind, he had found her <u><b>shadow-boxing</b></u> and named the chore he was avoiding as her ‘punishment’ to prevent her from <b>overexerting</b> herself.	Shadowboxing es un ejercicio de deporte de combate en el que una persona lanza puñetazos al aire como si hubiera un oponente. Practicado principalmente en el boxeo, se utiliza principalmente para preparar los músculos antes de que la persona que entrena se involucre en una actividad física más fuerte.	
She <u><b>steepled</b></u> her hands together, resting both elbows on her desk and leaning forward. “I’m going to assume his Royal Grumpiness wouldn’t let you get a word in <u><b>edgewise</b></u>?” 	"<u><b>Juntó</b></u> las manos, apoyando ambos codos en su escritorio e inclinándose hacia adelante. ""¿Voy a asumir que su Royal Grumpiness no te dejaría decir una palabra?"""	
The younger woman <u><b>slumped</b></u>, letting the fight <u><b>drain out</b></u> of her.  “He’s such an insufferable runt.”	"La mujer más joven se <u><b>desplomó</b></u>, dejando que la pelea se <u><b>escapara</b></u> de ella. ""Es un enano tan insoportable""."	
She stepped up next to Levi, looking over the stone edge of the <u><b>parapet</b></u>. A light wind was blowing, the scent of <u><b>petrichor</b></u> and ozone signaling the approach of a thunderstorm.	Se acercó a Levi y miró por encima del borde de piedra del <u><b>parapeto</b></u>. Soplaba un viento suave, el olor a <u><b>petricor</b></u> y ozono indicaba la proximidad de una tormenta eléctrica.	
It had nothing to do with the fact that he had been able to sleep for only a couple of hours before he’d woken up with his dick harder than it’d been in years and hands already working on ripping the laces of his <u><b>breeches</b></u> open. He hissed through his teeth when he freed himself and grasped it, hips <u><b>bucking</b></u> into the touch with how sensitive he was. He rarely indulged in his baser instincts, less often as he got older, not finding the mess afterwards worth the release. Levi bit the inside of his cheek, legs falling open wider as he moved with quick, efficient strokes and continued the dream that had left him in this state. His eyes closed and fantasized it was a different hand, equally calloused, moving against his flesh while her other kept his wrists pinned down above him.		
A muffled groan slipped past his lips as he swiped a thumb across the tip, smearing the precum down and allowing his hand to move easier as he squeezed harder. The woman in his fantasy licked her lips, a mischievous smirk on them as she straddled him and teased just out of reach as he bucked up. Black hair fell over her eyes as she moved to hold his hips down in his mind, forcing him to remain still, remaining in control and refusing his attempts at relief. There was a pressure in his lower back, balls tightening as his orgasm started building up. The woman in his head sank down, grey eyes darkening to black in pleasure and letting out a sigh.<br><br>“Levi…”		
He truly, fully didn’t know how to handle this situation that was so far out of his comfort zone. She peeled the goggles off her head, setting them to the side and leaning back into her chair. “What’s the part bothering you the most?”<br><br>“Everything. I’m too old to be like this.” Levi grumbled, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. “How do you deal with it?”<br><br>She bared her teeth in a leer. “I enjoy the view. And if there’s a mutual interest, I sometimes indulge in some extraneous fun on my off days.” She laughed at the horrified and incredulous look the man gave her between his fingers. “What, did you think I was a virgin?”		
Ignoring his glare that was ruined by the gaping mouth again, the Commander started turning this revelation over in her head more. She had noticed the two seemed to be interacting more, had been happy the grumpy man was allowing another friend in his life. He’d emotional shut down almost fully after Erwin’s death. If there was anyone who had the highest probability of surviving the upcoming war, it was the withdrawn woman. Their temperaments were compatible when they didn’t let the competitive side of each other takeover, and they were both too stubborn to let the other walk all over them.		
The young man rolled desperately away from her, alternating between sucking in air and <u><b>hacking it out</b></u>. A soft “tch” was heard behind him as Eren staggered back up to his feet, he had not been expecting her to move that fast. His arms flew up as the woman closed in, gritting his teeth as his forearms accepted the <u><b>brunt</b></u> of her strike. For all that it rattled the bones and made him swear they felt shattered, he knew she was holding back. Another fist landed against his arms, driving him stumbling backwards. Armin bit a knuckle as he watched his two childhood friends, eyes <u><b>straying</b></u> to a small dark spot spreading on Mikasa’s pants.	"El joven rodó desesperadamente lejos de ella, alternando entre aspirar aire y <u><b>sacarlo</b></u>. Se escuchó un suave ""tch"" detrás de él cuando Eren se tambaleó y se puso de pie, no había esperado que ella se moviera tan rápido. Sus brazos volaron hacia arriba cuando la mujer se acercó, apretando los dientes mientras sus antebrazos aceptaban la <u><b>peor parte</b></u> de su golpe. Por todo lo que hizo temblar los huesos y le hizo jurar que se sentían destrozados, sabía que ella se estaba conteniendo. Otro puño aterrizó en sus brazos, haciéndolo tropezar hacia atrás. Armin se mordió un nudillo mientras miraba a sus dos amigos de la infancia, sus ojos se <u><b>desviaron</b></u> hacia una pequeña mancha oscura que se extendía por los pantalones de Mikasa."	
Three nights sleeping in the <u><b>rafters</b></u> was more than enough to make her miss the hard beds the military provided them with.	Tres noches durmiendo en las <u><b>vigas</b></u> fueron más que suficientes para que echara de menos las camas duras que les proporcionan los militares.	
She's <u><b>dazedly</b></u> spitting sand, <u><b>inside-out</b></u> and <b><em>topsy-turvy</em></b> and nauseous <u><b>to her core</b></u>. A <b><em>briny</em></b> breeze is raking across her oversensitive skin.	Está escupiendo arena <u><b>aturdida</b></u>, <b><u>de adentro hacia afuera</u></b> y <b><em>al revés</em></b> y con náuseas <u><b>hasta la médula</b></u>. Una brisa <em><b>salobre</b></em> azota su piel hipersensible.	
The cannonball <u><b>scalps off</b></u> the rest of the roof. Mikasa doesn't notice. It's like the sky <u><b>falls in</b></u> with a roar so tremendous sound is sucked away into the wound left behind, and Mikasa is numb and <u><b>flailing</b></u> and the world is black. Right up until -	La bala de cañón <u><b>arranca</b></u> el resto del techo. Mikasa no se da cuenta. Es como si el cielo se <u><b>derrumbara</b></u> con un rugido tan tremendo que se succionaba hacia la herida dejada atrás, y Mikasa está entumecida y <u><b>agitada</b></u> y el mundo es negro. Justo hasta ...	
Tiny, rapid thumping, approaching fast. Breathing hard through her mouth, Mikasa turns. Twin jets of sand <u><b>skittering</b></u> toward her in perfect rows up the beach, <u><b>pistoning</b></u> up one after the other quick as lightning. She stares, <u><b>slackjawed</b></u>.	Pequeños y rápidos golpes, acercándose rápidamente. Respirando con fuerza por la boca, Mikasa se gira. Chorros gemelos de arena se <u><b>deslizaban</b></u> hacia ella en filas perfectas por la playa, <u><b>subiendo</b></u> uno tras otro rápido como un rayo. Ella mira, <u><b>boquiabierta</b></u>.	
En ouvrant la fenêtre, Livaï vit à ce moment une jeune recrue du Bataillon aux cheveux ébènes sortir d'un box un sceau à la main, <u><b>il tiqua</b></u>. Elle lui sembla familière, il l'avait déjà vu il en était certain mais il n'arrivait pas à se rappeler de quand et où... Intrigué, il regarda plus attentivement la jeune fille à l'écharpe rouge...	Al abrir la ventana, Levi vio en ese momento a una joven recluta del Batallón con el pelo color ébano saliendo de una caja con un sello en la mano, <b><u>se crispó</u></b>. Le parecía familiar, la había visto antes, estaba seguro, pero no recordaba cuándo ni dónde ... Desconcertado, miró con más atención a la joven de la bufanda roja ...	
Elle posa le sceau près du puit quand un petit hennissement se fit entendre, elle se retourna pour voir un étalon noir sortir sa tête hors de son box, elle s'approcha et leva la main, laissant l'animal renifler sa main avant qu'il ne colle son <u><b>museau</b></u> contre, de son autre main elle lui caressa la joue. Livaï fut étonné par la réaction de son cheval...	Puso el sello cerca del pozo cuando sonó un pequeño relincho, se giró para ver a un semental negro sacando la cabeza de su establo, se acercó y levantó la mano, dejando que el animal olfatee su mano antes de que no le meta el <u><b>hocico</b></u>. contra él, con la otra mano le acarició la mejilla. Levi estaba asombrado por la reacción de su caballo ...	
Growing up in a shithole and witnessing the hopeless cause that is humanity doesn’t exactly leave one with a cheery disposition. But the options were either give up or <b>trudge through</b>. And Levi was no quitter; as long as he had a decent cup of tea, a clean space, and as little exposure to idiots as possible, he could manage <b>trudging</b>.	Crecer en un pozo de mierda y ser testigo de la causa desesperada que es la humanidad no deja a uno exactamente con una disposición alegre. Pero las opciones eran renunciar o <b>seguir adelante</b>. Y Levi no se rinde; Siempre que tuviera una taza de té decente, un espacio limpio y la menor exposición posible a los idiotas, podría <b>caminar con dificultad</b>.	AOT
The man wasn’t particularly tall, standing maybe an inch or two higher than Mikasa, but he was built like a tree and covered in tattoos, from his bare, muscular arms up to his neck, concluding in a detailed design of a <b>compass rose</b> on top of his <b>shaved pate</b>. He wasn’t old, though not particularly young—his eyes were a bright blue and he sported a full, dark beard, which gave him a somewhat roguish look.	El hombre no era particularmente alto, de pie tal vez una pulgada o dos más alto que Mikasa, pero tenía la constitución de un árbol y estaba cubierto de tatuajes, desde sus brazos desnudos y musculosos hasta su cuello, concluyendo en un diseño detallado de una <b>rosa de los vientos</b>. encima de su <b>paté afeitado</b>. No era viejo, aunque no particularmente joven; sus ojos eran de un azul brillante y lucía una barba espesa y oscura, lo que le daba un aspecto un tanto pícaro.	AOT
Pour Mikasa et trois autres soldats, ce matin c'était corvée de linge. Deux devaient faire la lessive, un étendait le linge tandis que le dernier repassait le linge de la veille. Ce fut Mikasa qui hérita de cette dernière corvée.	Para Mikasa y otros tres soldados, esta mañana fue una tarea de lavar la ropa. Dos tuvieron que lavar la ropa, una tendió la ropa y la última planchó la ropa del día anterior. Fue Mikasa quien heredó esta última tarea.	
"Quoi ? Il n'y a pas moyen que je vous laisse faire ma lessive, je suis passé voir le linge étendu, vous avez laissé des tâches. """	"Qué ? No hay forma de que te deje lavar mi ropa, fui a ver la ropa colgada, dejaste manchas. """	
Mais le collier ne tomba pas de lui même,  le cou de Mikasa était plus épais à présent que lorsque cet objet lui avait été <b>scellé</b> autour... 	Pero el collar no se cayó por sí solo, el cuello de Mikasa era más grueso ahora que cuando este objeto había sido <b>sellado</b> a su alrededor ...	
"C'est ce qui arrive quand on tape dans les <b>couilles</b> d'un mec... Ça a tendance à le refroidir ! """	"Esto es lo que sucede cuando golpeas las <b>bolas</b> de un chico ... ¡Tiende a enfriarlo! """	
when he realized that he kept staring at the brat <b>in a forlorn manner</b>.	Manera triste 	
“That would be logical, except the <b>nativity is green</b> and abundant, and there is no radiation or pollution detected anywhere.”		
It was a terrifying feeling, Levi thought, to be unconditionally devoted to a person, and for that person to be completely aware of this devotion, able to at any point take advantage of it as they wish.		
His devotion to Erwin would never be reciprocated, and no matter how much Erwin loved him, he was unable to love him in the same way Levi did.		
It took at least another hour of cramped <b>spelunking</b> before Levi noticed he could see better than he had a few meters before. 		
“You finally start <b>to pull your own weight</b> around here and you think you’re invincible? Go ahead and choke yourself, see if I care.” Furlan folded his arms across his chest and leaned back dramatically, stretching his legs beneath the table in a <b>show of nonchalance</b>.		
Just eat your food and try not to spray it all over the table with your <b>hollerin</b>’.”	Gritos	
With Isabel <b>ensconced</b> in her recently acquired bed upstairs and a heavy sleeper, Levi and Furlan had regained some of their private time together.		
Levi always slept rolled up in a ball, probably a habit obtained from sleeping in corners and on <b>rafters</b>, trying to stay unobtrusive and not shift around and fall.	Vigas	
He’d rather be the blunt asshole, than a conman hiding behind fake smiles and slippery words		
Levi felt the loss of his mother as the <b>indelible</b> truth that <b>time was always running out</b>, and he couldn’t help but begin mourning the people he had in his life even before they were gone.		
They had some rice left over from a previous meal, so he dumped it into a pan with a <b>dollop of lard</b> purchased in small jars from urchins from the surface.		
Furlan’s voice was still <b>husky</b> but he had a little more color in his face.		
Isabel was ready before Furlan and <b>bobbed up and down </b>on her toes in anticipation, while Levi waited for Furlan on the couch, arms crossed and eyes closed.		
“Took a while if I’m being honest, Izzy. He’s an <b>exacting</b> leader.”<br><br> 		
On the third pass, Levi dropped to his <b>haunches</b> near a overturned crate and traced a pattern on the wall with his fingertip. 		
He tensed in pain, ready to fight before he realized both Furlan and Isabel were <b>hovering in front of him,</b> trying to get him to stand up. 		
Shut up, both of you. Gideon came <b>tearin’ in</b> and <b>gave me a quick lowdown</b>. It was a fuckin’ set up and no one here is to blame. <b>Take a swig,</b> Stretch, ‘n sit down. I think you’re going into shock.”		
He was jealous of the Silent and their community, established through hard work and dedication in the Metalworks, so he purposely <b>eschewed</b> the use of signs in some weird form of protest against them.		
There was no finesse in Levi’s attack, the insinuation that the Spade would go anywhere near Levi’s family was <b>untenable</b>. 		
We’re startin’ to hear the name Livingston more and more, and I don’t like it. Lovof and his fuckin’ taxes are enough of a problem without Livingston <b>sticking his people <b>in to rile</b> shit up</b> all the time,” Levi <b>groused</b>.<br><br>		
Going head-to-head with two Noble families doesn’t sound like sound <b>business acumen</b> to me.”<br><br> 		
The Nobles like to pretend they’re greater solely because they have coin, but you can <b>disabuse</b> them of that notion,” Elam explained,		
He would also need <b>vambraces</b> and guards for his shins that could fit into his boots to block strikes without breaking his legs and arms.		
“There’s no shame in <b>forfeiture</b>,” the man said kindly.<br><br>	Pérdida 	
Levi replaced the <b>jerkin</b> with a loose shirt, taking the time to carefully tuck the hem into his pants.	Justillo: prenda interior sin mangas que ciñe el cuerpo y no baja de la cintura.	
They were prepared to help instigate a public relations nightmare through the newspapers Above if the Nobles attempted to violently lock down the Underground residents or make <b>unconscionable restrictions</b> in bringing goods into the Underground City.	Restricciones desmedidas	
“It’ll probably be a <b>moot point</b>, but I’ll need to convince them we’ve got fresh ideas—You’ll get credit, of course.” Shadis shook his head with a grim smile of amusement at some joke only <b>he was privy</b> too.<br><br> Punto discutible, estaba al tanto 		
There was the occasion <b>tryst</b> during or after some of his fundraising duties, where he was very careful not to end up tied to some lower Noble’s family or a merchant group trying to better their circumstances.		
<br>It was one thing to go Below for purely recreational pursuits, and another to go in any official capacity as a military officer. Though Erwin’s meeting was not completely <b>aboveboard</b>, he was not naïve enough to believe the MPs dealings with the Nobles and Undergrounders alike were always working within the confines of the King’s laws either.		
“Good to hear, I hope her health <b>holds true</b>.”<br><br> 		
While Mike and Erwin made their rounds in the capital, Moblit began his infiltration of Lovof’s network of <b>cronies and sycophants. </b>		
A drunken brawl spilled into the street nearing the end of the first day of waiting; time just didn’t seem to matter much in the dark and drinking and <b>carousing</b> appeared to continue almost nonstop in some locations		
Would they have set themselves up as the nobility of the Underground, moved to the surface somehow and continued their lives of crime, or finally met their demise through accident or<b> pure hubris</b>?		
Isabel was full of equally creative responses until a firm Isabel, from Levi, silenced her. She still <b>looked at their hecklers</b> with narrowed eyes and the occasion protruding tongue but was otherwise more compliant.		
The trio chose a space a reasonable distance from the bars, putting one of the cell walls to their backs, and stood quietly waiting for Erwin <b>to ply his political acumen.</b>		
Everyone except Erwin, who was staring down at Levi like he’d just been given the greatest gift one could ever <b>bestow</b>.		
 “I will be meeting with High Commander Zackley to finalize the transfer, and you may be sure I will inform him of the <i>incredible</i> hospitality afforded to your guests. If you wish to file any complaints against our claim on these individuals, you may join us <b>forthwith</b>.”		
<b>The shit from this show</b> is going to be deep, Moblit.” Mike confided with a serious shake of his head. “Really, really deep.”<br><br> 		
The trio followed him. Isabel was in the lead, Furlan close behind her, and Levi trailing <b>nonchalantly</b> behind. He appeared to be checking the surrounding <b>balustrades</b> for enemies.	Despreocupadamente, balaustradas: balcones y terrazas modeladas en piedra o madera.	
Each participant was asked to strip to their <b>skivvies</b> before the doctor and his two assistants put them through the process. 		
“Levi’s probably being <b>tetchy</b> and it’s holding up the process. You know how he is. Don’t start making a racket or he’ll think your hurt and then we’ll never get out of here.”		
Watching the easy conversation between the two comrades and their treatment of the animals, the quiet smiles from Levi, and the outright head-thrown back laughter of Isabel was both wonderful and also made Mike feel uncomfortably like a voyeur observing intimate moments he shouldn’t <b>be privy to</b>.		
Furlan was very good at handling people. His ready smile and quick wit probably saved Levi from <b>spending time in the brig,</b> as he was able to defuse a few of the more serious situations where Flagon was really losing his cool.<br><br> 		
“That’s too bad, little <b>sourpuss</b> could really benefit from a little relaxation.”<br><br> 		
He shook himself back to action, replacing the files and actually making moves to clear the top of Blondie’s desk so he could clean the surface which was covered in a fine layer of dust. The only place that was clear, was the <b>blotter</b>, where Blondie must spend the most time working.		
“That can’t be true, there must be some people who’ve been able to make a better life for themselves—<b>bootstraps and all that.</b>” Erwin waved his hand in a circular motion, encouraging Mrs. Foster to continue her thoughts.		
They talked of mundane things—formations, tactics, and Erwin answered Levi’s seemly <b>non sequitur questions </b>about the surface that he’d occasional ask without any warning.		
It seemed that talking with Levi required one <b>to be nimble and cautious</b> in roughly equal parts.		
All Erwin had done that day long ago was stay silent, and he’d made sure Shadis, his Squad Leader at the time, didn’t see the hidden youth crouched behind the bookshelf. He could see it now, the resemblance. The look in the young man’s eyes hadn’t been one of terror or fear. <b>His first look had been of entreaty</b>, as if requesting Erwin’s silence. But the look in his eye when he’d been trapped on both sides, however unwitting one participant, the young man—no, Levi’s eyes—had been full of determination.		
Blondie hadn’t laughed at him when he’d admitted he didn’t know how to restart the fire. He’d explained the process patiently, and corrected Levi’s terminology—it wasn’t <b><i>setting</i> a fire but <i>laying</i> a fire</b>—and apparently there was an important distinction between the two that Levi couldn’t quite grasp.		
The poisoner was no amateur though, and managed to get himself into a low crouch, pulling a very small blade from his boot that Levi recognized as a <b>gimlet</b>. The weapon was easily concealed and usually held between two fingers squeezed in a tight fist, having a small handle perpendicular to the blade instead of a full hilt, with a blade measuring no more than fifty millimeters in length.		
There was always a ball to break the monotony of the winter months for the Nobles, and the King had <b>retainers in charge</b> of every aspect of the extravagant event. Shadis hated dealing with this part of the politics of being Commander.		
Shadis and Erwin arrived together at the appointed place and time, the offices of the King’s <b>retainers</b> being even more <b>garish</b> than Zackley’s. 		
Erwin was busy, swooping in and out, trying to avoid two titans that were <b>vying</b> for the honor of eating the blond men.<br><br> 		
Levi’d found himself in the old records room organizing, dusting, and massacring whatever vermin were hidden in the recesses of the large storage room just to keep himself busy. He did what he would consider a <b>cursory job,</b> figuring he might have more time during the off-season from expeditions to give a more thorough reorganization.	Superficial, no detallado 	
He was doing a pretty good job of hiding it, but the concussion had him a <b>little off kilter</b>. “You see Erwin?”		
He needs someone to watch his back. ‘S usually me, but they won’t let me outta here and Erwin ordered me to stay put. You know how he is about orders,” Mike <b>groused</b>. Levi rolled his eyes and nodded.<br><br> 		
Either way, he wasn’t planning <b>to balk under</b> the other man’s gaze. He was a hard ass, but Shadis didn’t come close to exuding the same level of intimidation as Kenny back in the day. 		
“Seems a small thing with the <b>gravitas</b> of an expedition in the works, but we’re almost home now, so I guess it’s a reasonable time to acknowledge another year.”		
Levi didn’t realize where they were headed until they arrived at the front of the establishment and Levi recognized the tavern from when he’d <b>shadowed</b> Isabel and Furlan from the rooftops on their outing with the Scouts. Levi hadn’t gone inside to watch their <b>revelries</b>, not wanting to ruin the evening if he was accidentally recognized, so he’d stayed on the rooftop across the street and waited for them to exit. 		
Everyone took healthy swigs from their drinks and Levi <b>nimbly</b> avoided being patted on the shoulder by both a slightly inebriated Moblit and a truly <b>sloshed</b> Hange as he made his way around the table to claim the empty seat at Erwin’s side.		
Levi raised his shoulder for the dual purpose of showing Erwin, he’d heard him and at the same time <b>dispelling</b> the strangely pleasant tickle of the man’s breath in his ear.		
“Ah, to be so young, stupidly brave, and optimistic. Don’t wait too long my dear. I want to have someone to pass this place down to when I’m old and <b>doddering</b>.”<br><br> 		
If you can’t trust yourself, and you won’t fuckin’ listen to me, then trust the bond. I know I could leave you if I wanted to. You were able to go to Mitras without me. It’s not a fuckin’ leash, it’s a <b>tether</b>. We’re not alone anymore and it wasn’t a choice made consciously, but whatever choices we make goin’ forward are. 		
He would take what he could get, for as long as he was allowed. Living off of scraps was something he understood. It was the feeling of being <b>surfeit</b> he had trouble dealing with.		
There was no time for <b>wallowing</b> or self-recrimination. Expeditions beyond the Walls were finished for the year but that didn’t mean the paperwork and training would cease. 		
Next thing Erwin knew an arrow was sprouting from Levi’s shoulder and the smaller man was knocked flat onto his back. He was only down for a second before he let out a roar of absolute fury and launched himself back to his feet in a quick <b>kipping</b> motion. 		
“No society is perfect, Mike, and in terms of the dealing with the Underground, ours is definitely <b>remiss</b>.” Erwin started to read carefully, and Mike sat anxiously on the opposite side of the desk.		
“In the end, it’s not explicitly stated, but the decision to <b>remand</b> Levi to outside custody should be in the hands of the of Commander of the Scouts. As long as Shadis wants Levi here, we’re in the clear. 		
Levi made it through the press conference without collapsing, but it was a near thing. As soon as they returned to the main building of the Barracks, Levi leaned against the wall and <b>teetered</b> precariously, his eyes squeezed closed in pain and exhaustion.		
“I’ll admit it is nice to be wanted,” Levi admitted softly. “You sure you want to take this path, cause I’m pretty sure I’ve got a <b>whole slew</b> of abandonment issues and I’ll be damned if I’ll let you go once I’ve got you.”		
It looked like they were going to try and <b>pincher</b> Levi, attacking him from above and below in order to give their squad leader a chance to make it to the finish with the acquired strips of cloth.		
Can you honestly say he hasn’t proven time and time again that he can not only kill titans with brutal efficiency, but that he believes in the overall <b>tenants</b> of the Survey Corps?”		
“Fine. You keep a <b><b>steady winch</b></b> and let me adjust my speed to compensate for any instability. Let’s start with the two high posts, there—and let’s get some height before angling left into the first ring.”		
“You’re strong for sure, but your still just a man. You’re not invincible you know, and you can be hurt. I’d <b>posit</b> a lot of your flexibility and strength actually comes from hard work and good genetics. The extra bit only seems to occur when you’re really focused on saving someone. And not just anyone, I might add, someone special to you in some way.”		
It belonged to Izzy. She wanted a <b>signet ring</b> like a Noble, but we didn’t want it to be gaudy cause it would just get lost or stolen, so we had a friend inscribe the inside of a ring we found for her.”		
Mike and the rest of the team <b>were already ensconced</b>at the usual table and Erwin and Levi joined them and quickly set to eating their meals.	Ya estaban instalados 	
“They’re good soldiers, there’s no denying but I fear Marlow and his team lack the <b>gumption</b> to take risks.”	Agallas, coraje	
Your <b>wise quips</b> did a stellar job at irritating him but he didn’t want you strapped with a fine or anything of the sort.	Clever taunting funny remark	
When they’d found him <b>traipsing through the marshes</b>, Jean thought the squad were Marleyan forces and knocked out three people before Levi managed to kick the son of a bitch to the ground and make him see sense.	Caminando por los pantanos 	
You were <b>bold</b> in your diction, and <b>blasé</b> in your actions. 	Audaz, indiferente 	
Erwin asked with a knowing smirk. Levi wasn’t exactly lying, but he could feel that Levi was t<b>alking around the point</b>. The bond only made him more certain of Levi’s <b>dissembling</b>.	Disimulo, disimulando 	
It’s <b>convoluted</b> at best and most likely a criminal waste of resources of the Walls, but all <b>salvos</b> will be veiled in gaudy <b>verbal repartee </b>and not in the slash of blades or the power of a fist.

He slowly donned his mask of authority and when he looked to the side to check to make sure Levi was still with him, Levi had adopted his blank faced glare, appearing to observe the gathering with only <b>cursory interest.</b>	Interés superficial 	
It would <b>behoove</b> Erwin to speak to the gathering guests now and assess which would need extra coaxing, either tonight or later in the week.		
Levi’s fingers were already itching to dispossess many of the guests of their <b>gaudy accoutrements</b>, but the royal family and their retinue put the other guests to shame with their finery.

“You say it’s not worth risking everything we’ve built for one man,” Elam began, looking at Ophelia calmly, face empty of both anger and <b>entreaty</b>.

Erwin sent two missives to Moblit, knowing the man would be able to pass on the second update to Gregory, since the Beggar King would be interested in being <b>kept abreast</b> of the fate of the Underground residents.	Mantenerse al tanto 	
“Be that as it may, sometimes it’s hard to anticipate what frighteningly exciting thing might occur next, when you’re involved,” Doc continued, while Levi tried to look <b>properly contrite.</b>		
<br>“Fuck, Doc, I’m not stupid. I’ll take a break, I promise. I don’t think Erwin’s gonna be letting me <b>frolic about</b> without supervision for a while,” Levi confided, gesturing at Erwin sitting <b>ramrod straight</b> on the chair next to the bed, his face grim. “Doc said I only popped a couple of sutures, why do you look like I tried to feed myself to a shitty titan on purpose?”<br><br> 		
“Haha, he’s got you there, Erwin. Just admit he beat you at your own game a second time and move on,” Mike said from the far side of the room, leaning nonchalantly against the wall. Levi watched Erwin’s face turn even more serious at the reminder of Levi’s <b>underhanded approach</b> to solving the assassin situation.<br><br> Done in a secret or deshonest way		
"Although he was almost jeopardized when he was abducted by Kenny, so we had to rescue him from the Underground.""<br><br><b>Cue the gasp</b>, ""How did that go?"""	From stage cues, for gasping

Rolling his neck from side to side to <b>loosen kinks</b>, Eren's focus drifted as he slowly became drowsy.	Aflojar las torceduras 	
"Are you asking yourself, or me?"" <b>Eren needled.</b><br><br>""Tch, rude brat,"" Levi said, ""What did I do in the future?"""	Eren aguzó	
It felt somewhat like a cosmic joke to Levi that whenever he allowed himself to have something, it slipped through his fingers like fine sand.		
He already lost count on how many times he tried to confront the captain before <b>copping out</b>. 		
Still, even though he knew that their relationship wouldn't be the same because of what he did, he was still being drawn in by his <b>heady presence</b>.		
Some might be frustrated but for Eren, he preferred things to be like this because the man he admired was someone who <b>forged ahead</b> with a goal in mind.		
“Unfortunately, reality is a nasty byproduct of living,” Levi dryly said, making him chuckle.

At first, I thought he was just another soldier trying to save his own skin—one of the many who’d break the second they <b>ran out of road.</b> 		
and at least when he returned to the <b>till</b>, he’d be able to sit for a while. 		
“There was nothing … There were a couple customers who were annoying as fuck and my leg is throbbing so maybe I was a bit <b>crabby</b>—”		
She’d taught her kid well, too, and that, combined with the girl’s eagerness to <b>ingratiate</b> herself with him (and his soft spot for her) had made the whole experience much less traumatic that he’d anticipated. 		
He wasn’t a burden. He was a goddamn force <b>to be reckoned with.</b>		
You sighed to the sky, stepping out of form before motioning to all of them to try and do what you just did. It was a <b>travesty</b>.		
It would force the Corps to come to his aid if they wanted to keep the power of his Titans on-side, backing them into a corner. He knew that, but didn’t have many <b>qualms</b> about it.		
 “Don’t play coy, Eren. I’ve stared at enough human faces over the centuries to know when they’ve been <b>put on the back foot</b>.”		
She supposed their friendship had been built while <b>slinking off</b> to corners to whisper between themselves		
“You don’t know what a crush is? Braus is supposed to be the country <b>bumpkin</b>, not you!”		
What did Reiner and Bertholdt do, other than <b>gallivant</b> with their friends?		
These outings with Armin were nothing more than sessions of <b>make-believe</b>. 		
The squad had pulled their horses into a natural <b>alcove</b> formed by massive, <b>gnarled roots</b>. <b>Moss-covered bark</b> rose around them like fortress walls, but the temporary shelter did little to ease Eren's growing unease.		
can turn a regular <b>steer</b> into a prized bull, 		
Behind him loomed rows of wooden structures reminiscent of <b>trebuchets</b>, with ropes ready to be attached to the trainees' belts for a hanging exercise that would test their balance and strength.		
<b>Regale</b> yourself with the <b>pitter-patter</b> of the rain, the delicate droplets that descend towards the pavement in an arbitrary yet constant rhythm. 		
Study the birds that <b>flap</b> their wings in a casual uniformity that aligns with the breathing of the wind. 		
“You just got here!” They <b>holler</b>, and Levi lifts his middle finger up toward them in response.		
Plus, actually caring about it will earn you <b>brownie points</b> from Hange, too. Their research is their passion.” <br><br> 		
 “All of our hometown’s death that day was nothing more than a <b>fib</b> he could play into to buy our sympathy.”		
Kolets' mind provided the words “<b>brougham</b>” but the scouts had just called it a two seat carriage, three, if you count the <b>chauffeur</b>. 		
Mr. Bonelli, a very finely dressed thin man with a <b>coat beard</b> and combed back black hair. The <b>high strung look</b> was finalized with glasses with a golden chain. 		
“Yes, but there’s five full teams of them, that’s an <b>overshot</b> for this mission.” 		
It was <b>arresting</b>, the way the slim body moved, slowly, in a way Levi hadn’t seen before, turning straight towards him.l		
He didn’t look <b>skittish</b>, but he did look intense, as he kept looking at Levi across the hallway.		
Kolet looked <b>frazzled</b>, to put it mildly, and Levi didn’t feel like introducing a <b>frazzled</b> looking, stupidly talented doctor boy, to a stupidly talented and possibly insane Hange . <br><br> 		
A flash, a memory of a poorly hidden <b>tryst</b> he walked into one time comes to the forefront of his mind, and he absently wonders if they look the same? A couple too anxious and excited to care where they are, frantic, eager bodies rubbing against each other in a poorly chosen hiding place, too lost in the moment, too greedy for the passion the other was giving to notice or care if someone found them out. 		
letting Kolet take control of the kiss again, and he <b>revels</b> in the way the eager mouth takes his, 		
Their height difference makes <b>rutting</b> against the wall easy and Levi boldly flips Kolet’s belt open, groaning from his throat when Kolet sucks his tongue at the same time.		
Levi <b>hummed</b>, pleased and aroused, giving him a good <b>grind</b> with his hips, making Kolet <b>squirm</b> and <b>groan</b> in his mouth. 		
And when Kolet <b>keened</b> , Levi couldn’t stop the triumphant <b>smirk</b>, a rare expression that Kolet didn’t see, for his head dropped down on Levi’s shoulder and he <b>shuddered</b> . 		
“I know I’m too <b>hasty</b>. That there are steps I should probably take. I told you, I don’t know how to <b>court</b>…how to do this right, but Levi… ” he breathed his name, and Levi felt his stomach drop and turn into <b>frenzied butterflies</b>,”You make me so greedy .”		
feeling his own cock <b>pulse</b> and <b>twitch</b> angrily		
<b>teased</b> Kolet’s ear with his lips, giving it a little lick. Kolet <b>sucked breath</b>, loudly, and <b>moaned</b>, unashamedly loud		
and then he felt his <b>belt tucked.</b> He had to pull back a little and look down. 		
<b>weave</b> of thick and <b>heedy</b> pleasure spread from his <b>loins</b> all over his body, his breath <b>stuttering</b> from the force of it. 		
He <b>pinned</b> Kolet against the wall, <b>angling</b> himself so that he could move his hips but Kolet couldn’t, not unless Levi’s <b>groping</b> hand on Kolet’s ass let him move.		
Levi. More.” Kolet growled and Levi almost came then and there. Then the greedy mouth <b>crashed</b> into his and <b>blunged</b> the equally greedy tongue into his mouth and Kolet’s long fingers that were laced with his, left their joined cocks, only to <b>cup over</b> their <b>swollen</b> glands.		
All he cared about was the needy hand <b>rubbing</b> their glands, eliciting pleasure both familiar and new, and the almost vicious mouth sucking his tongue, 		
It felt like it lasted longer than it probably did, the pleasure <b>clouded</b> his mind, making him <b>ride a high so intense</b> it was stupid. It made him almost <b>giddy</b>, happy. Stupidly happy. 		
It’s a <b>point of contention</b> that he has never caught Mikasa, she is always too fast, too aware of him and how he moves.		
When at last the weather let up, only a steady <b>drizzle</b> of rain remaining, Eren felt like he had a permanent <b>crick</b> in his neck		
"""They’re too scared to move. I can understand why... but abandoning their mission to <b>resupply</b> us, just to hide in HQ? Unbelievable. And of course, the Titans have <b>swarmed</b> them, so we can’t get any more <b>gas</b>..."""		
"Without our <b>manoeuvring gear</b>, we really <b>are done for</b>!"" Connie said, his voice loud and firm."		
"Connie looked down at Jean. ""The <b>supply team</b>... what happened to them? Were they wiped out?"""		
" ""Ugh... not great. I’ve got barely enough for a few more minutes of movement. If I don’t <b>conserve</b> it, I’ll be a <b>sitting duck</b>."""		
Vivienne stirred slightly, and when she finally turned to look at him, there was no anger in her eyes. No <b>sharp retort</b>, no insult at his hesitation. Just a <b>quiet understanding</b>.		
but as Levi crested the final dirt <b>ledge</b> of the <b>riverbank</b>, his strength gave out and he flopped onto his chest. 		
If either of them had been the type to <b>relent</b>, someone would have spoken by now, but silence sits heavy in the room.		
admittedly he was finding it <b>tuff</b>, the raven leader seemed to know every alleyway and nook to run through.		
With his friends safe up in the <b>boughs</b> Eren dropped his titan form at last		
Once they were out the door, Levi locked the <b>doorknob</b> and the <b>deadbolt</b>, got his wheelchair out of the kitchen, and headed to his room.		
The district was the very definition of a <b>backwater</b>, siting on the very edge of the walls, with little to offer itself, and that was before folks heard the rumors about the spiders.		
Andrew had had absolutely no idea Grisha even knew those kinds of words, let alone what his wife apparently <b>sported in</b> her vocabulary. 		
"""SHIT! CARLA WATCH OUT, IT'S TRYING TO <b>FLANK</b> YOU!"""		
Andrew watched <b>wordlessly</b> as Grisha <b>tromped back</b> down the stairs. He had some kind of orange <b>ichor</b> splashed over the front of his shirt and was sporting a bloody gash across his shoulders.		
"I'm sorry,"" Grisha said, as he calmly bent the <b>iron poker</b> back into something close to it's original shape and hung it by the fireplace"		
He <b>cracked open</b> the lid, four long <b>segmented</b> legs languidly reached out from the darkness, followed by a eight <b>beady</b> black eyes, a large <b>bulbous</b> body, and four more legs.		
His business done he made to head back to the <b>barracks</b> when a <b>rustling</b> from a bush caught his attention.		
Jean would claim later that he didn't scream. That half of the base that claimed to have been woken up by a <b>banshee</b> that night told a different story. 		
The next thing Jean knew, there was this blonde blur, and the spider was suddenly lying <b>belly-up</b> on the grass, a bread knife sticking out of its <b>thorax</b>.		
Armin, still in his pajamas, watched Jean through sleepy eyes as the other boy tried to get his <b>heart-rate</b> back under control.		
"""Was it at least a big spider?""<br><br>Armin snorted. ""Tiny little thing.""<br><br>""<b>Wimp</b>."""		
 It was at least the size of a fully grown <b>draft horse</b>. 		
"""What <b>prey-tell</b> then, do you call that!?"" Shadis roared, gesturing to the dead spider."
