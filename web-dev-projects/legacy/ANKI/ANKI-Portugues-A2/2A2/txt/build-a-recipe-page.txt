    <h1>Pancakes from Scratch</h1>
    <p>There's nothing better than homemade pancakes made with simple, fresh ingredients. This easy recipe makes light, fluffy pancakes—perfect for a cozy breakfast or brunch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg and mix in the milk, melted butter, and honey.</li>
      <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Do not overmix—it's okay if the batter is a little lumpy.</li>
      <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter.</li>
      <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.</li>
      <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2–3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Flip and cook for another 1–2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
      <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings—like fruit, syrup, or extra honey.</li>
    </ol>
