# hotels_in_Singapore
Codecademy practice setting CSS rules to conform to the expectations for breadcrumb navigation applied to a fake site is listing hotels in Singapore.

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

## Description
There are two html files. index.html has links to breadcrumbs.css and breadcrumbs_attribute.css which is commented (shows how an attribute breadcrumb would look).   index_arrow_effect.html links to breadcrumbs_arrow_effect.css for a different style.
