# the_summit
Navigation design exercise from Codecademy. The goal was to improve the user experience of a ski lodge landing page. Must improve the clickable elements.

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

## Description
There's only a index.html page and two css files. The basic styles are laid out in starting.css (provided). And the exercise's code was added to the blank style.css file for writing the code with less clutter.

#### To-do list:
* The last button "sledding" does not fit the page and its moved to the next line. Must check it and adjust it latter.
* The code seem responsive good enough, but I have no idea what it's doing - Must give it a look.
