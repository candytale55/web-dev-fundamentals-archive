<!--
    Due to the difference in pixel density between a "Retina" and "Non-Retina" displays, some images that have not been made with a High-Resolution Display in mind could look "pixelated" when rendered on a High-Resolution display.

    The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is.

<style>
    img {
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
    }
</style>
