Use this prompt when you want ChatGPT to generate bilingual README.md files for your projects:

---

**Prompt to Copy and Use:**

> I want you to generate two versions of a `README.md` file for a small project, one in English and one in Spanish (`README.md` and `README.es.md`).  
> 
> Keep the tone simple and clear — this is for personal or academic use, not commercial.  
> 
> Please include:  
> – Project title  
> – A short description  
> – Technologies used (keep tech names in English)  
> – Main features  
> – Setup instructions  
> – How to use it  
> – Project status  
> – Screenshots section (with two images: desktop and mobile view)  
> – Acknowledgements  
> 
> In the English version, add a link at the top to the Spanish version.  
> In the Spanish version, add a link at the top back to the English one.  
> Keep the formatting clean and use Markdown best practices.  
> Use the same content for both, just translated.  

You should provide your project’s basic info, any tutorial instructions (if applicable), and your code.
