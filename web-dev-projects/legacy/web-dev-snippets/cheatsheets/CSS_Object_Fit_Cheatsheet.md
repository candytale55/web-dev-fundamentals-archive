## üéØ What Is `object-fit`?

The `object-fit` property in CSS defines **how the content of a replaced element** (like `<img>`, `<video>`, `<iframe>`, etc.) should **fit within its container**, particularly when the container size doesn't match the aspect ratio of the content.

It works **like `background-size` but for actual media elements**, not backgrounds.

## üîß Syntax

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

## üß∞ Common Values of `object-fit`

| Value        | What It Does                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fill`       | **(default)** Stretches the media to fill the container, may **distort** it     |
| `contain`    | Resizes the media to fit inside the container while **preserving aspect ratio** |
| `cover`      | Resizes the media to completely fill the container, **cropping if necessary**   |
| `none`       | Keeps the original size of the media, **no resizing**                           |
| `scale-down` | Acts like `none` or `contain`, whichever results in **smaller image**           |

## üìå When to Use It

* **Responsive Layouts**: You want your images/videos to fit neatly into a component with fixed width/height (e.g. cards, galleries).
* **Uniform Grids or Thumbnails**: You want all media to take the same visual space without worrying about their actual dimensions.
* **Hero or Banner Sections**: Where you want full-bleed media that covers the space regardless of its original size.

---

## ‚úÖ Example

```html
<div class="media-wrapper">
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo" />
</div>
```

```css
.media-wrapper {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.media-wrapper img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

This will **crop the image** to fill the container while keeping its aspect ratio.

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Not Setting Width and Height

`object-fit` **only works when the element has both `width` and `height`** defined.

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover; /* Will not work properly if width/height aren't set */
}
```

‚úÖ Fix:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

---

### ‚ùå Using `object-fit` on Non-Replaced Elements

`object-fit` **only works on replaced elements** like:

* `<img>`
* `<video>`
* `<iframe>`
* `<embed>`
* `<object>`

It **won‚Äôt work** on regular `<div>`, `<p>`, or similar elements.

---

### ‚ùå Expecting `object-fit` to Center the Content

By default, the **positioning** of the media is from the **top-left corner**.

To **center** the cropped image:

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: center;
}
```

---

### ‚ùå Forgetting Accessibility

Don‚Äôt let visual manipulation (cropping, scaling) remove **important parts** of an image (e.g., people‚Äôs faces, key info) unless you‚Äôre sure it's okay.

---

## üîÑ When **Not** to Use It

* **If maintaining the full, uncropped image is crucial**, use `contain` or let the image display at its native aspect ratio.
* **If you don't control the aspect ratio of media content**, `cover` could crop out important content ‚Äî use `contain` or `scale-down` instead.
* **When you're applying styling to non-replaced elements** ‚Äî `object-fit` won‚Äôt help.
