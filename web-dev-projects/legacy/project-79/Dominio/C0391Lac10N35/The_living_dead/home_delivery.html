        <p>
            Considering that it was probably the end of the world, Maddie Pace thought she was doing a good job. <em>Hell</em> of a good job. She thought, in fact, that she just might be coping with the End of Everything better than anyone else on earth. And she was <em>positive</em> she was coping better than any other <em>pregnant</em> woman on earth.
        </p>
        <p><em>Coping</em>.</p>
        <p>Maddie Pace, of all people.</p>
        <p>
            Maddie Pace, who sometimes couldn't sleep if, after a visit from Reverend Johnson, she spied a single speck of dust under the dinning-room table. Maddie Pace, who, as Maddie Sullivan, used to drive her fiancé, Jack, crazy when she froze over a menu, debating entrees sometimes for as long as half an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Maddie, why don't you just flip a coin?" he'd asked once after she had managed to narrow it down to a choice between the braised veal and the lamb chops, and then could get no further. "I've had five bottles of this goddam German beer already, and if you don't make up y'mind pretty damn quick, there's gonna be a drunk lobsterman <em>under</em> the table before we ever get any food <em>on</em> it!"
        </p>
        <p>
            So she had smiled nervously, ordered the braised veal, and spent most of the ride home wondering if the chops might not have been tastier, and therefore a better bargain despite their slightly higher price.
        </p>
        <p>
            She'd had no trouble coping with Jack's proposal of marriage, however; she'd accepted it —and him— quickly, and with tremendous relief. Following the death of her father, Maddie and her mother had lived an aimless, cloudy sort of life on Little Tall Island, off the coast of Maine. "If I wasn't around to tell them women where to squat and lean against the wheel," George Sullivan had been fond of saying while in his cups among his friends at Fudgy's Tavern or in the back room of Prout's Barber Shop, "I don't know what'n the hell they'd do."
        </p>
        <p>
            When her father died of a massive coronary, Maddie was nineteen and minding the town library weekday evenings at a salary of $41.50 a week. Her mother minded the house	—or did, that was, when George reminded her (sometimes with a good hard shot to the ear) that she had a house which needed minding.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the news of his death came, the two women had looked at each other with silent, panicky dismay, two pairs of eyes asking the same question: <em>What do we do now?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Neither of them knew, but they both felt —felt strongly— that he had been right in his assessment of them: they needed him. They were just women, and they needed him to tell them not just what to do, but how to do it, as well. They didn't speak of it because it embarrassed them, but there it was —they hadn't the slightless clue as to what came next, and the idea that they were prisoners of George Sullivan's narrow ideas and expectations did not so much as cross their minds. They were not stupid women, either of them, but they <em>were</em> island women. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Money wasn't the problem; George had believed passionately in insurance, and when he dropped down dead during the tiebreaker frame of the League Bowl-Offs at Big Duke's Big Ten in Machias, his wife had come into better than a hundred thousand dollars. And island life was cheap, if you owned your place and kept your garden tended and they knew how to put by your own vegetables come fall. The <em>problem</em> was having nothing to focus on. The <em>problem</em> was how the centre seemed to have dropped out of their lives when George went facedown in his Island Amoco bowling shirt just over the foul line of lane nineteen (and goddam if he hadn't picked up the spare his team had needed to win, too). With George gone their lives had become an eerie sort of blur.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>It's like being lost in heavy fog</em>, Maddie thought sometimes. <em>Only instead of looking for the road, or a house, or the village, or jsut some landmark like that lightning-struck pine out on the point, I am looking for the wheel. If I can ever find it, maybe I can tell myself to squat and lean my shoulder to it.</em> 
        </p>
        <p>
            At last she found her wheel: it turned out to be Jack Pace. Women marry their fathers and men their mothers, some say, and while such a broad statement can hadly be true all of the time, it was close enough for government work in Maddie's case. Her father had been looked upon by his peers with fear and admiration— "Don't fool with George Sullivan, dear" they'd say. "He'll knock the nose offf your face if you so much as look at him wrong."
        </p>
        <p>
            It was true at home, too. He'd been domineering and sometimes physically abusive, but he'd also known things to want and work for, like the Ford pick-up, the chainsaw, or those two acres that bounded their place to the south. Pop Cook's land. George Sullivan had been known to refer to Pop Cook as one armpit-stinky old bastid, but the old man's aroma didn't change the fact that there was quite a lot of good hardwood left on those two acres. Pop didn't know it because he had gone to living across the reach in 1987, when his arthritis really went to town on him, and George let it be known on Little Tall that what that bastid Pop Cook didn't know wouldn't hurt him none, and furthermore, he would disjoint the man or woman that let light into the darkness of Pop's ignorance. No one did, and eventually the Sullivans got the land, and the hardwood on it. Of course the good wood was all logged off inside of three years, but George said that didn't matter a tinker's damn; land always paid for itself in the end. That was what George said and they believed him, believed <em>in</em> him, and they worked, all three of them. He said: You got to put your shoulder to this wheel and <em>push</em> the bitch, you got to push ha'ad because she don't move easy. So that was what they did.
        </p>
        <p>
            In those days Maddie's mother had kept a produce stand on the road from East Head, and there were always plenty of tourists who bought the vegetables she grew (which were the ones George <em>told</em> her to grow, of course), and even though they were never exactly what her mother called "the Gotrocks family," they made out. Even in years when lobstering was bad and they had to stretch their finances even further in order to keep paying off what they owed the bank on Pop Cook's two acres, they made out.

                    Stephen King is the best-selling, award-winning author of innumerable classics, including <cite>The Shinning</cite>, <cite>Carrie</cite>, <cite>Cujo</cite>, and <cite>The Dead Zone</cite>. Each of those books has been adapted to film, as have many of King's other novels and stories. Other projects include editing <cite>Best American Short Stories 2007</cite>, and his recent collaboration on a musical with John Mellencamp called <cite>Ghost Brothers of Darkland County</cite>. King's latest novel, <cite>Duma Key</cite>, was published in early 2008. A new short fiction collection, <cite>Just After Sunset</cite>, is due out in November.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although King is probably the world's foremost horror writer, he hasn't frequently explored the subject of zombies in his fiction. His recent novel <cite>Cell</cite>, however, <em>is</em> about zombies and of course, there's this story. Also of possible zombie relevance is King's novel <cite>Pet Sematary</cite>; if not zombies per se, it certainly contains zombie-like things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This story first appeared in <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>. As with much of King's fiction, it takes place in a small town in Maine, and using that point of view examines a menacing supernatural horror. And as much of King's fiction, it manages to at once be both horrific and affecting.
