        <p>
            This is a story about being lost in the woods.
        </p>
        <p>
            This guy Soap is at a party out in the suburbs. The thing you need to know about Soap is that he keeps a small framed oil painting in the trunk of his car. The painting is about the size of a paperback novel. Wherever Soap goes, this oil painting goes with him. But he leaves the painting in the trunk of his car, because you don't walk around a party carrying a painting. People will think you're weird.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soap doesn't know anyone here. He's crashed the party, which is what he does now, when he feels lonely. On weekends, he just drives around the suburbs until he finds one of those summer twilight parties that are so big that they spill out to the yard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kids are out on the lawn of a two-story house, lying on the damp grass and drinking beer out of plastic cups. Soap has brought along a six-pack. It's the least he can do. He walks through the house, past four black guys sitting all over a couch. They're watching a football game and there's some music on the stereo. The television is on mute. Over by the TV, a white girl is dancing by herself. When she gets too close to it, the guys on the couch start complaining.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soap finds the kitchen. There's one of those big professional ovens and a lot of expensive-looking knives stuck to a magnetic strip on the wall. It's funny, Soap thinks, how expensive stuff always look more dangerous, and also safer, both of these things at the same time. He pokes around in the fridge and finds some pre-sliced cheese and English muffins. He grabs three slices of cheese, the muffins, and puts the beer in the fridge. There's also a couple of steaks, and so he taks one out, heats up the broiler.
        </p>
        <p>
            A girl wanders into the kitchen. She's black and her hair goes up and up and on top are these sturdy, springy curls like little waves. Toe to top of her architectural haircut, she's as tall as Soap. She has eyes the color of iceberg lettuce. There's a heart-shapped rhinestone under one green eye. The rhinestone winks at Soap like it knows him. She's gorgeous, but Soap knows better than to fool around with girls who aren't out of high school yet, maybe. "What are you doing?" she says.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Cooking a steak," Soap says. "Want one?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," she says. "I already ate."
        </p>
        <p>
            She sits up on the counter beside the sink and swings her legs. She's wearing a bikini top, pink shorts, and no shoes. "Who are you?" she says.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Will," Soap says, although Will isn't his name. Soap isn't his real name, either.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm Carly," she says. "You want a beer?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "There's beer in the fridge," Will says, and Carly says, "I know there is."
        </p>
        <p>
            Will opens and closes drawers and cabinet doors until he's found a plate, a fork and a knife, and garlic salt. He takes his steak out of the oven.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You go to State?" Carly says. She pops off the beer top against the lip of the kitchen counter, and Will knows she's showing off.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," Will says. He sits down at the kitchen table and cuts off a piece of steak. He's been lonely ever since he and his friend Mike got out of prison and Mike went out to Seattle. It's nice to sit in a kitchen and talk to a girl.
        </p>
        <p>
            "So what do you do?" Carly says. She sits down at the table, across from him. She lifts her arms up and stretches until her back cracks. She's got nice tits.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Telemarketing," Will says, and Carly makes a face.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That sucks," she says.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah," Will says. "No, it isn't too bad. I like talking to people. I just got out of prison." He taks another big bite of steak.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No way," Carly says. "What did you do?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Will chews. He swallows. "I don't want to talk about it right now."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Okay," Carly says.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you like museums?" Will says. She looks like a girl who goes to museums.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some drunk white kid wanders into the kitchen. He says hey to Will and then he lies down on the floor with his head under Carly's chair. "Carly, Carly, Carly," he says. "I am so in love with you right now. You're the most beautiful girl in the world. And you don't even know my name. That's hurtful."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Museums are okay," Carly says. "I like concerts. Jazz. Improvisational comedy. I like stuff that isn't the same every time you look at it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How about zombies?" Will says. No more steak. He mops up meat juice with one of the muffins. Maybe he could eat another one of those steaks. The kid wiht his head under Carly's chair says, "Carly? Carly? Carly? I like it when you sit on my face, Carly."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You mean like horror movies?" Carly says.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The living dead," says the kid under the chair. "The walking dead. Why do the dead walk everywhere? Why don't they just catch the bus?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "You still hungry" Carly says to Will. "I could make you some cinnamon toast. Or some soup."
        </p>
        <p>
            "They could carpool," the kid under the chair says. "Hey y'all, I don't know why they call carpools <em>carpools</em>. It's not like there are cars with swimming pools in them. Because people might drown on their way to school. What a weird word. Carpool. Carpool. Carly's pool. There are naked people in Carly's pool, but Carly isn't naked in Carly's pool."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Is there a phone around here?" Will says. "I was thinking I should call my dad. He's having open-heart surgery tomorrow."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It's not his name, but let's call him Soap. That's what they called him in prison, although not for the reasons you're thinking. When he was a kid, he'd read a book about a boy named Soap. So he didn't mind the nickname. It was better than Oatmeal, which is what one guy ended up getting called. You don't want to know why Oatmeal got called Oatmeal. It would put you off oatmeal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soap was in prison for six months. In some ways, six months isn't a long time. You spend longer inside your mother. But six months in prison is enough time to think about things and all around you, everybody else is thinking too. It can make you go crazy, wondering what other people are thinking about. Some guys thought about hteir families, and other guys thought about revenge, or how they were going to get rich. Some guys took correspondence courses or fell in love because of what one of the volunteer art instructors said about one of their watercolors. Soap didn't take an art course, but he thought about art. Art was why Soap was in prison. This sounded romantic, but really it was just stupid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even before Soap and his friend Mike went to prison, Soap was sure that he'd had opinions about art, even though he hadn't known much about art. It was the same with prison. Art and prison were the kind of things that you had opinions about, even if you didn't know anything about them. Soap still didn't know much about art. These were some of the things that he had known about art before prison:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            He knew what he liked when he saw it. As it had turned out, he knew what he liked, even when he couldn't see it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Museums gave him hiccups. He had hiccups a lot of the time while he was in prison too.
        </p>
        <p>
            These were some of the things Soap figured out about art while he was in prison:
        </p>
        <p>
            Great art came out of great suffering. Soap had gone through a lot of shit because of art.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a difference between art, which you just looked at, and things like soap, which you used. Even if the soap smelled so good that you didn't want to use it, only smell it. This was why people got so pissed off about art. Because you didn't eat it, and you didn't sleep on it, and you couldn't put it up your nose. A lot of people said things like "That's not art" when whatever they were talking about could clearly not have been anything else, except art.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Soap got tired of thinking about art, he thought about zombies. He worked on his zombie contingency plan. Thinking about zombies was less tiring than thinking about art. Here's what Soap knew about zombies:
        </p>
        <p>
            Zombies were not about sex.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zombies were not interested in art.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zombies weren't complicated. It wasn't like werewolves or ghosts or vampires. Vampires, for example, were the middle / upper-middle management of the supernatural world. Some people thought of vampires as rock stars, but really they were more like Martha Stewart. Vampires were prissy. They had to follow rules. They had to look good. Zombies wren't like that. You couldn't exorcise zombies. You didn't need luxury items like silver bullets or crucifixes or holy water. You just shot zombies in the head, or set fire to them, or hit them over the head really hard. There were some guys in the prison who knew about that. There were guys in the prison who knew anything you might want to know about. There were guys who knew things that you didn't want to knwo. It was like a library, except it wasn't.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zombies didn't discriminate. Everyone tasted equally good as far as zombies were concerned. And anyone could <em>be</em> a zombie. You didn't have to be special, or good at sports, or good-looking. You didn't have to smell good, or wear the right kind of clothes, or listen to the right kind of music. You just had to be slow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soap liked this about zombies.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is never just one zombie.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was something about clowns that was worse than zombies. (Or maybe something that was the same. When you see a zombie, you want to laugh at first. When you see a clown, most poeple get a little nervous. There's the pallor and the cakey mortician-style makeup, the shuffling and the untidy hair. But clowns were probably malicious, and the moved fast on those bicycles and in those little, crammed cars. Zombies weren't much of anything. They didn't carry musical instruments and they didn't care whether or not you laughed at them. You always knew what zombies wanted.) Given a choice, Soap would take zombies over clowns any day. There was a white guy in the prison who had been a clown. Nobody was sure why he was in prison.

                    Kelly Link is the author of many wonderful short stories, which have been collected in two volumes - <cite>Stranger Things Happen</cite> and <cite>Magic for Beginners</cite>- with a third, <cite>Pretty Monsters</cite>, due out shortly. Her short fiction has appeared in <cite>The Magazine of Fantasy &Science Fiction</cite>, <cite>Realms of Fantasy</cite>, <cite>Asimov's Science Fiction</cite>, <cite>Conjunctions</cite>, and in anthologies such as <cite>McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales</cite>, <cite>The Dark</cite>, <cite>The Faery Reel</cite>, and <cite>Best American Short Stories</cite>. With her husband, Gabin J. Grant, Link runs Small Beer Press and edits the zine <cite>Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet</cite>. Grant and Link also co-edit (with Ellen Datlow) <cite>The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror</cite> annual. Her fiction has earned her an NEA Literature Fellowship and won a variety of awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Stoker, Tiptree, and Locus awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Some Zombie Contingency Plans" first appeared in Link's collection, <cite>Magic for Beginners</cite> (which, incidentally, also includes another great zombie sotry called "The Hortlak"). As this story illustrates, a zombie contingency plan is an important thing to have, so before we progress any further in this anthology, you should have a look at this tale so that you can stop and consider a plan of your own. In fact you may want to think about that now; although this book is rather weighty tome it probably wouldn't make very effective weapon against the living dead.
