<!--
Headings (h1 - h6 ) help provide structure and labeling to content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page to get a summary. 

It is important for the heading tags to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.

Each page should always have only one h1 element, which is the main subject.

The heading tags need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationship in thecontent. 

Headings with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the previous ones.

A page with an h2 element followed by several subsections labelled with h4 tags would confuse a screen reader user.
