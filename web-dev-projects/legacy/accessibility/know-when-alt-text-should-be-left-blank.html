<!--
Sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only => alt text may seem redundant or unnecessary.

In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute set to an empty string.

Background images usually fall under 'decorative', but they are typically applied with CSS and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.

Note: For images with a caption, you may still want to include alt text, since it helps search engines catalog the content of the image.
