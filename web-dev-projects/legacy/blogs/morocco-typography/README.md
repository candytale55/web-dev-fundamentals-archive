# morocco_typography

Practice project for HTML + CSS focused on typography. Modify the typography on a website, changing the size, style, and font families, to make the page easier to read. 

"Aoife Conleavy is a novelist who has been writing about her travels for nearly two decades. Before the launch of her new novel Tide Blade, which features the stories of real-life characters in Morocco . . . "


## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning.

## Description
There are two index.html files. The one named index.html is my take on the project, using different images and working from scratch. The file original_index.html is the finished version as intended in the Codecademy exercise.

#### To-do list:
* Improve the header.
* The page doesn't extend to the whole viewport. 
* The text shrinks badly. Must add responsive design.
* Links (add changes of state)
