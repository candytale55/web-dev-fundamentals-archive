# rise-of-soccer_article

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. 

## Description
Simple sports article - exercise from Codecademy to understand basic css.

#### TO DO list:
* It would be nice to change the boring font family used. Not that it matters for the exercise but I don't like it.
* Also the layout of the caption at the bottom could be improved ("_The local semi- pro soccer team in Seattle, WA plays an international friendly_")
