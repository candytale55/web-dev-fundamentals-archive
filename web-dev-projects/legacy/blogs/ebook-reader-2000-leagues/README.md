# transitions-online-reader-20000-leagues

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. 

## Description
HTML & CSS online reader for Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. It has a content section that displays when you click on an arrow to the left, and some words display its definition when clicked as a popup window on the top. The project uses transistions. 

#### To-do list:
* Improve the media queries. Text size seems too large for larger devices.
