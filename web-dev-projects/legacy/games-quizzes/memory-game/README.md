# test_your_memory

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. It's a static webpage, it doesn't let you play the game for real. I guess this was intended to learn positioning in CSS.

## Description
A classic memory board with starred squares that changes color when hovered over. 
_Click on a tile below to reveal a symbol. Click on another tile to try and reveal two of the same symbols. The game is over when all the cards have been matched._

#### To-do list:
* The memory squares should form either a square or rectangle. There shouldn't be lines with less squares because they fit the lines above.
* Add the memory cards and the actual code to play the game.
