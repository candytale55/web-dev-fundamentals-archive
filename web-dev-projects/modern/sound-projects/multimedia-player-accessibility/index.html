            [Music begins: ticking clockwork, followed by rising violins]
            <br />
            Narrator (voiceover): "In the heart of Marketsquare Plaza, where iron hooves once galloped and gears turned
            dreams into motion, a dance unfolds. Cloaked in steam and velvet, the Chrono Nocturnes bring to life the
            poetry of revolution and rhythm."
            <br /><br />
            [Dance steps echo, gears whirring in tempo]
            <br />
            Narrator: "Each movement is a tribute to time — precise, bold, and fleeting. Watch as the dancers spiral
            beneath King George's gaze, in defiance of rust and ruin."
