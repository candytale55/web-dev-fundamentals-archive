# Steampunk Multimedia Player

A responsive multimedia player built with **semantic HTML5** and **CSS3**, focused on accessibility best practices.
This project showcases how to properly embed and style audio and video content with descriptive text and captions, while maintaining full screen-reader support.

This is a personalized version of the [freeCodeCamp Multimedia Player Lab](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-multimedia-player/lab-multimedia-player). The theme was adapted to represent a fictional steampunk band.

## Project Status

**Completed: June 2025**
This mockup project was completed as part of a tutorial archive and adapted to better understand media accessibility with `aria-label`, `track`, and semantic HTML elements.

---

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** ‚Äì Semantic layout with proper use of `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<source>`, `<track>`, and ARIA roles
* **CSS3** ‚Äì Responsive styling for mobile and wide screens
* **No JavaScript required** ‚Äì Pure HTML & CSS demo

> Tested in Chrome and Firefox.

---

## Features

* Two audio players for music and transcript playback
* One embedded video with subtitles
* `<track>` element with `.vtt` captions file
* Accessible markup using `aria-label` attributes
* Responsive layout that adjusts between mobile and desktop screens
* Fully semantic structure using `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` elements

---

## Setup Instructions

## Key HTML & Accessibility Concepts Used

| Concept               | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<audio>` & `<video>` | Core media embedding elements with controls         |
| `<source>`            | Specifies the media file and type                   |
| `type` attribute      | Helps the browser determine how to decode the media |
| `aria-label`          | Provides descriptive labels for screen readers      |
| `<track>`             | Enables subtitles or captions using `.vtt` files    |
| `srclang` & `label`   | Language and naming metadata for the captions track |
| `<section>` & `<h2>`  | Organizes content semantically and accessibly       |

---

## Educational Purpose

This project was created to:

* Practice using `<audio>` and `<video>` elements
* Learn how to embed accessible multimedia content
* Understand the purpose of `<track>` for captions
* Apply ARIA attributes (`aria-label`) effectively
* Use `<source>` with correct `type` values for compatibility
* Gain hands-on experience with responsive layout design

### üîß Summary of Mistakes:

| Issue                                        | Explanation                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå `<audio>` with `src` directly              | You should nest a `<source>` inside the `<audio>` element with `src` and `type` attributes.                           |
| ‚ùå `<audio>` with `type` attribute            | The `<audio>` tag itself doesn't need a `type`. Use it inside `<source>` instead.                                     |
| ‚ùå Missing `width` on `<video>`               | The `<video>` element should have a `width` attribute like `width="640"` to pass the requirement.                     |
| ‚ùå Placeholder subtitle `src="subtitles.vtt"` | This file likely doesn‚Äôt exist. Replace with an actual `.vtt` URL or a placeholder note that it‚Äôs not functional yet. |
