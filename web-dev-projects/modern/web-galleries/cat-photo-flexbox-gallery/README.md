# CSS Flexbox Photo Gallery

A simple and responsive photo gallery created with HTML and CSS using the Flexbox layout model. This exercise demonstrates how Flexbox can be used to arrange items predictably on different screen sizes and browsers, making it ideal for creating dynamic, responsive layouts.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure for layout
- **CSS3** – Flexbox layout, box model, borders, padding, and object-fit

## Main Features

- Fully responsive photo gallery layout using Flexbox
- Images arranged in a flexible, multi-column layout that adjusts based on screen size
- Customizable image dimensions and layout behavior
- Uses Flexbox properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap` to create a responsive design
- Border-radius and object-fit applied for visual enhancement and image consistency


## Setup Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that both `index.html` and `styles.css` are in the same directory.
