# JavaScript Music Player

A fully functional, responsive music player built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. This project was developed as part of freeCodeCamp’s JavaScript curriculum to practice string and array methods while building a real-world application.

The player supports playing, pausing, skipping, shuffling, and deleting songs, along with an accessible UI and dynamic playlist rendering.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and array/string methods  
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure for audio player and playlist  
- **CSS3** – Responsive styling for desktop and mobile layouts, Flexbox, and accessible UI states  

Tested with modern browsers supporting ES6+ (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

## Main Features

- Dynamic playlist rendering with song titles, artists, and durations  
- Play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle controls  
- Resume playback from the last paused position  
- Highlighting the currently playing song in the playlist  
- Delete songs from the playlist with immediate UI update  
- Reset playlist button appears when all songs are deleted  
- Accessible controls with meaningful ARIA labels for screen readers  
- Responsive design with separate layouts for desktop and mobile  
- Audio events used to auto-play next song and update UI on song end
