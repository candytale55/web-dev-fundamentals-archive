# Stylized To-Do List

A minimal HTML and CSS project focused on styling interactive links using CSS pseudo-classes.

This project was built as part of [freeCodeCamp’s "Build a Stylized To-Do List" Lab](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-stylized-to-do-list/build-a-stylized-to-do-list), which introduces learners to link states such as `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:visited`, while reinforcing clean HTML structure and accessibility best practices.

## 📌 Project Status

**Completed: June 2025**  
This lab was completed to demonstrate how to style anchor tags in various user interaction states and build a responsive, styled to-do list interface.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was designed to help learners:

- Apply CSS pseudo-classes to anchor elements
- Understand the order and effect of `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:visited`
- Practice semantic HTML markup using lists, checkboxes, and labels
- Create accessible navigation through visible focus styles
- Style a basic responsive layout with minimal CSS

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic list structure with accessible checkboxes and labels  
- **CSS3** – Custom styles for interactive link states and responsive layout  

> Responsive design tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

## ✅ Features

- Anchor tags with the following styles:
  - `:hover` — changes link color on mouseover  
  - `:focus` — applies a visible outline when tabbed to  
  - `:active` — shows color change while being clicked  
  - `:visited` — displays a different color after visiting  
- Removal of default underline from anchor tags
- Subtasks presented as nested links beneath each item
- Media queries for basic responsive behavior
