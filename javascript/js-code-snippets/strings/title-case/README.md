# Capitalizing_Strings_JS_Py
Different ways to capitalize strings in JavaScript and Python

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

#### To-do list:
* Try and understand other given solutions here: https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/freecodecamp-challenge-guide-title-case-a-sentence/16088
* Do the same in Python
* Don't capitalize words like the, of, etc.


## Technologies
* Javascript ES6
* Python 3

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _finished_, - but there are other solutions I haven't tried. So I probably revist.
