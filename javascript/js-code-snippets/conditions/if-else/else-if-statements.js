/*
 An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
We can add more conditions using else if statements.
Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.
The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
 
 You can add as many else if statements as you’d like, to make more complex conditionals!

The else if statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes. if/else if/else statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true from the top to bottom is the block that gets executed.

The else if statement always comes after the if statement and before the else statement. The else if statement also takes a condition. Let’s take a look at the syntax

let stopLight = 'yellow';

if (stopLight === 'red') {
  console.log('Stop!');
} else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
  console.log('Slow down.');
} else if (stopLight === 'green') {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Caution, unknown!');
}

/*
 since stopLight === 'red' evaluates to false and stopLight === 'yellow' evaluates to true, the code inside the first else if statement is executed. The rest of the conditions are not evaluated. If none of the conditions evaluated to true, then the code in the else statement would have executed.
