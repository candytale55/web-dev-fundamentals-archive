# Check_if_all_letters_in_a_word_are_contained_in_another


## Description

function _mutation_ returns true if the string in the first element of an array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

* For example, ["hello", "Hello"], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case. 
* ["Alien", "line"], should return true because all of the letters in line are present in Alien.
* The arguments ["hello", "hey"] should return false because the string hello does not contain a y.
