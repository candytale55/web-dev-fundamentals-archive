### 🟢 `build-a-pyramid-generator.js`
✅ Solution to the **current exercise** on freeCodeCamp:  
🔗 https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-pyramid-generator/lab-pyramid-generator

This version **passes all test cases**, including:
- Starts and ends with a `\n`
- Matches exact spacing requirements
- Handles inverted pyramids correctly

  📝 Notes to self:
- fCC tests are strict about **output formatting**, not just logic.

### 🔵 `build-a-pyramid-generator-my-choice.js`
This version is **my personal preference**.  
It returns a visually correct pyramid (with symmetrical blank spaces), but:
- ❌ It does **not** return a leading/trailing `\n`
- ❌ It includes spacing on both sides, which causes it to fail fCC's test cases

Still, this is what I would have used if the exercise allowed for more flexibility in formatting.
