# JavaScript Football Team Cards

An interactive, responsive web app that showcases football player cards using **vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5**, and **CSS3**. This project was built as part of [freeCodeCamp’s Modern JavaScript curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-modern-javascript-methods-by-building-football-team-cards/step-1) to strengthen skills in **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **object destructuring**, and **data filtering**.

The app dynamically updates player information based on filter criteria (such as nickname or position), demonstrating real-world use of JavaScript’s modern methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `switch`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM interaction, dynamic rendering, event handling, destructuring, and filtering logic  
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure for accessible content  
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout with Flexbox, mobile-first design, and theme via CSS custom properties  

Tested across modern browsers that support ES6+ (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

## ⚽ Main Features

- Team data rendered dynamically using template literals and DOM manipulation  
- Dropdown filter to view teammates by position or nickname  
- Responsive layout that adjusts from multi-column to single-column on mobile  
- Data filtering using `.filter()` and control flow via `switch`  
- Clean, accessible UI with consistent styling and logical structure  
- Demonstrates use of `Object.freeze()` to prevent mutation of core data  
- Lightweight and framework-free for educational clarity and full control

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.  
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and `img`) are in the same directory.  
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to launch the app.

## 👨‍🏫 How to Use

- Review the team information at the top.
- Use the dropdown menu to filter players:
  - By **position** (forward, midfielder, defender, goalkeeper)
  - Or only those with a **nickname**
- The UI updates automatically based on the selected filter.
