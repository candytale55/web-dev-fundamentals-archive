A simple book filtering and sorting utility built with **vanilla JavaScript**.

This project was created as part of [freeCodeCamp’s Book Organizer Lab](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-book-organizer/build-a-book-organizer), designed to help learners understand how to use **higher-order functions** like `.filter()` and `.sort()`.

---

## Project Status

**Completed: July 2025**
This lab was completed to demonstrate the use of custom comparator functions and array filtering using JavaScript.

---

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic using `.filter()`, `.sort()`, and callback functions

---

## Features

* Maintains an array of books with title, author, and release year
* Filters books released after a given year
* Sorts the filtered results using a custom comparator callback
* Demonstrates clean and readable functional programming patterns

## Project Structure

```
.
└── script.js          # Contains the book data and sorting/filtering logic
```

## Educational Purpose

This project fulfills the following learning objectives:

* Practice writing and passing **callback functions** to higher-order functions
* Understand how `.filter()` and `.sort()` behave, including **in-place mutations**
* Learn how to structure small functional programs in plain JavaScript
