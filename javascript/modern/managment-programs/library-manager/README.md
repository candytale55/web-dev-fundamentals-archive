# Library Manager Workshop

A simple **library manager** built with **vanilla JavaScript** to practice higher-order array methods such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

This project was created as part of the [freeCodeCamp Library Manager Workshop](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/workshop-library-manager/), which focuses on hands-on experience working with JavaScript array methods and functional programming concepts.

## Project Status

**Completed: July 2025**  
This project was developed to reinforce understanding of array iteration methods by building practical functions that manipulate and summarize data from a collection of book objects.

---

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic using array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
- **No HTML or CSS** — Console-based output  

---

## Features

- Display all books in a formatted list with title, author, and page count  
- Extract and list book summaries (descriptions)  
- Filter books by author name  
- Calculate the total number of pages across all books

## Project Structure

```

.
├── script.js           # Arrow functions version of library manager
├── script-passed.js    # Declared function version (tutorial final version)

```

---

## Usage Instructions


1. Copy either `script.js` (arrow functions) or `script-passed.js` (declared functions) from the repository to your local environment.

2. Run the copied file in your JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js or browser console).

3. Check the console output to see:
   - The full list of books  
   - Book summaries  
   - Books by a specific author  
   - Total page count

## Educational Purpose

This project is ideal for learners who want to:

- Gain practical experience using higher-order functions on arrays (map, filter and reduce) 
- Understand how to process and summarize data structures in JavaScript  
- Compare arrow functions with declared functions in real code
