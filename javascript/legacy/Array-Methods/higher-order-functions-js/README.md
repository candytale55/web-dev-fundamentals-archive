# my_JS_notes_higher_order_functions
Personal notes of stuff. Small code examples of basic concepts. 
Including examples of callback funtions used with:
forEach(), map(), filter(), findIndex(), reduce()

Higher-order functions are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This is better for reading and debuging and to make more modular code. This can be used to build abstractions on top of other abstractions, just like “Keep the house clean” is an abstraction that may include another abstraction like “Take out the trash.”
