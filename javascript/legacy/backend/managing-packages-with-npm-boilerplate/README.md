# Backend Challenges -managing packages with npm - package.json
Set of exercises used to _"learn the basics of using npm, including how to work with the package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies"_.

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. These notes are for myself, just in case I have to do this again because it was very tricky to pass the tests, even when the solutions are correct. 
 
I tried with: 
* github (this repository) - **Unsuccessful**
* replit [here](https://replit.com/@CandyTale55/candytale55-npm-freeCodeCamp) - **Unsuccessful**
* glitch [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/gleaming-shining-hellebore?path=package.json%3A19%3A21) - **Successful**

If you find this repository because you are looking for help to pass the tests, follow the steps below but please don't cheat by copying the code. The excercises are really really easy, the issue is not with the code.

#### Notes to self - Steps taken:
* Glitch:
  * Paste the live site link: click on _share_ => copy the _Live Site_ link
  * Refresh the glitch window when you're done with the changes before pasting the _live site_ link and running the tests in the freeCodeCamp window. If you don't refresh first, the freeCodeCamp test may display an error, when there's really none.
  * Check for commas. Don't add a comma to the last item of lists or objects. The test may fail just because the comma. 

### To-Dos
* I may try to make it work with replit or github just to get rid of the frustration. 

## Technologies
* npm
* glitch
* JS6

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _finished_, - kept for future reference.
