# Calculate-Weight-in-Planets

> Though an objectâ€™s mass remains consistent throughout the universe, weight is determined by the force of gravity on an object. Since different planets have different gravity, the same object would weigh different amounts on each of those planets.  Function calculates weight in planets other than earth, taking two parameters: weight (in Earth) + planet
