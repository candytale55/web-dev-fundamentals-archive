# meal_maker

A random way to decide what you are going to eat. JS creates randomly a three-course meal based on a menu and the total cost of said menu.

Practice with objects, setters, getters and object functions in app.js . 

App.js sends the result to index.html. Index.html is not really relevant, it's only there to do my tests.
