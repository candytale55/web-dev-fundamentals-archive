# golf_score_JS
These are my solutions to a problem from freeCodeCamp. The reason I keep them here is because I sometimes come back and solve them in different ways and it's easier to have them all in the same place.

## Description
In the game of golf each hole has a par meaning the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in a hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par the strokes are, there is a different nickname.  The function golfScore will be passed par and strokes arguments and must return the correct string according to this list:

(No. of strokes)  must display "string"

(  1  )         "Hole-in-one!"

( <= par - 2 )  "Eagle"

( par - 1 )     "Birdie"

(   par   )     "Par"

( par + 1 )     "Bogey"

( par + 2 )     "Double Bogey"

( >= par + 3 )  "Go Home!"
