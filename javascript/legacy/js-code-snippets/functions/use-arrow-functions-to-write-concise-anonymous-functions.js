In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

  const myVar = "value";

ES6 syntactic sugar makes possible to use arrow function syntax:

  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}

/*
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

const myFatArrowFunc2 = () => "value"; // This code will still return value by default.
