# String Manipulation Examples - Javascript

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. These are my personal notes. 

## Description of functions: 

* Function **_repeatStringNumTimes_** repeats a given string _str_ (first argument) for num times (second argument). Example of different solutions.

* The **_sentensify_** function takes an argument _str_. The string is not divided by spaces, but for hyphens, points, commas, etc.  
This uses the split method to get ridded by the non-word characters and the join method to make a sentence from the words in the string str. 

* Function _findLongestWordLength_ takes one String argument _str_ and returns the length of the longest word in string. Different solutions using arrays + for loops, .split, reduce + Math.max, .map + Math.max + spread operator, and recursion.

### Note to self: if not here, check also these:

* [Capitalizing_Strings_JS_Py](https://github.com/candytale55/Capitalizing_Strings_JS_Py)



#### To-do list:
* Do everything in Python (just for fun).
* Go see if you can use recursion or simplify them. 

## Technologies
* Javascript ES6

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
