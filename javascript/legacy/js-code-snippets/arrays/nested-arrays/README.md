# JS_Loops_with_Nested_Arrays_examples
JavaScript examples for iterators on nested arrays to find or modify one or more elements on nested arrays. Learning notes.  

## General info

Arrays as data structures: arrays can contain, or even be completely made up of other arrays. Arrays can contain an infinite depth of arrays that can contain other arrays, each with their own arbitrary levels of depth, and so on. 

An array can very quickly become very complex data structure, known as a multi-dimensional, or nested array. 

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to keep notes, it is just personal learning. I may add different solutions and examples as I find them. 

Right now it includes examples of iterating arrays and especially nested arrays with for loops, either to find one or more elements or manipulate the array based on which data items meet a certain criteria. They are focused on the for loop, not in built-in (such as every(), forEach(), map(), etc.)

#### To-do list:
* Do the same with built-in methods.
* Do the same in Python.
* There are notes in some of the files to check particular to-dos.

## Technologies
* Javascript ES6

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _finished_, - Kept as notes for future reference.

## Based
Based on FreeCodeCamp's and Codecademy's excercises.
