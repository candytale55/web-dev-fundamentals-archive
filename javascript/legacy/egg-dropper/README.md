# Egg_Dropper_Code_Challenge
You have 100 eggs in a 100-floor skyscraper. You want to conduct an experiment to find out the highest floor (the **_critical floor_**) from which you could drop an egg without breaking it. . . . But you are also very hungry, so you don't want to waste eggs. 

## Description


#### Easy:

__minEggDropper100__ will determine the minimum number of egg drops (**_minDrops100_**) you’d need to find the **_criticalFloor_**.
* If an egg survives the fall it can be reused.
* Broken eggs must be discarded.
* Eggs are similar – the effect of a fall from a particular floor is the same for all eggs.
* If an egg survives a fall from floor n, it would also survive a fall from the floors below it (floor n-1, floor n-2).
* If an egg does not survive a fall from floor n, it would also not survive a fall from the floors above it (floor n+1, floor n+2, etc.)
* Don't assumean egg would survive a fall from the first floor or that it would not survive a fall from the 100th floor.


#### Intermediate: 

__minEggDropper2__ will determine the minimum number of egg drops (**_minDrops2__**) you’d need to find the highest floor (**_criticalFloor2_**) from which you could drop an egg without breaking it.


#### Hard: 

__minEggDropperX__  will test for *_x_* many eggs and *_y_* many floors. 


## Technologies
* Javascript ES6
* Python 3

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_ 
Right now I've only written the definition of the problem. :P
