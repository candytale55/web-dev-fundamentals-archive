## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. 

## Description
Query Codecademy project - Add dynamic behavior to navigation menu (displays and gets hidden again) and buttons (change colors when hovered).

#### To-do list:
* When you click on menu on the navigation bar, the options are displayed, but you can't hover over them to select any, as soon as you move down the navigation bar, it gets hidden again.
* There's a way to add emojis, but I don't know where it is or how to use it. Must find out where. 
* The buttons only change color when hovered, they don't retain the color when clicked.
