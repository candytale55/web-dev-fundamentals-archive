# madison_square_market


## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. 

## Description
jQuery Codecademy exercise - Use jQuery to make drop-down menus appear and disappear on home page.

#### To-do list:
* The display menus takes too long to disapear.
* Add hovering effects over the menus.
* I created another skeleton for a similar jQuery page [here](https://github.com/candytale55/marketplace). It would be good to also finish it.
