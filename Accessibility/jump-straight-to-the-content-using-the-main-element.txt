<!--
There should be only main element per page. 

It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic. 

It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.

It also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to  quickly navigate to the main content. (Like "Jump to Main Content" links at the top of a page). A main tag automatically gives assistive devices that functionality.
