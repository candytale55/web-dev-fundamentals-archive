# Profile-Lookup__FCC_JS
FCC exercise to learn functions. lookUpProfile() function takes a name and a property (_prop_) as arguments and checks if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

## Description
Array _objects_ represents different people in our contacts lists. 

_lookUpProfile_ function takes _name_ and a property (_prop_) as arguments. The function checks if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.  
* If both are true, returns the "value" of that property.
* If _name_ does not correspond to any contacts then returns the string "No such contact".
* If _prop_ does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match _name_, it returns the string "No such property".

#### To-do list:
* Do the same in Python.

## Technologies
* Javascript ES6

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, - Kept for reference.
